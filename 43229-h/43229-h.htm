<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>We call our little book "<span class="smcap">The Hawthorn</span>." We chose
the name of a blossom for our young readers, in preference
to that of a gem, because the cold glittering beauty
of the latter has little in common with the affectionateness,
and beaming freshness of the young, to whom the nature
of flowers seems more analogous.</p>

<p>When the young man came to the blessed Saviour to
inquire as to eternal life, he bade him keep the commandments,
and being told "all these things have I observed;"
it is then recorded that, "Jesus beholding him,
loved him." We know too, that he "loved little children,"
for he "took them in his arms," in token of tenderness;
we infer that he loved the flowers likewise, for
he said, "consider the lilies of the field;" and we find
the most beautiful illustrations of the Divine precepts of
Jesus borrowed from the kingdom of flowers.</p>

<p>What wonder then that we should love these delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span>
creations; and that when we wish to appeal to the young
and the trustful, the hopeful and the good, we should seek
these, for appropriate utterance.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"They tremble on the Alpine height,</div>
<div class="line i1h">  The fissur'd rock they press,</div>
<div class="line i0h">The desert wild with heat and sand</div>
<div class="line i1h">  Shares too, their blessedness;</div>
<div class="line i0h">And wheresoe'er the weary heart</div>
<div class="line i1h">  Turns in its dim despair,</div>
<div class="line i0h">The meek eyed blossom upward looks</div>
<div class="line i1h">  Inviting it to prayer."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Thus it is, my dear friends, that we present you, not
a Bouquett, which, however tasteful, and however beautiful,
might still confuse you with its many significations; we
present you not a Gem, to remind you of the brilliancy of
mind, that may yet be unsympathizing, and bewildering,
but a simple flower, one, from a paradise of freshness and
beauty.</p>

<h2>FREDERICK ORMSBY.</h2>

<p>Mr. Ormsby, a gentleman residing in the city of
New-York, took his family to West Point, to spend a
week of unusually warm weather at the close of
spring, and to see his nephew Gustavus, who had
been a cadet at the Military Academy for near three
years, and who was a boy of a very different disposition
from Frederick Ormsby, being spirited, manly,
and of a most amiable temper. Frederick, whose
age was almost thirteen, was not entirely devoid of
good qualities; but he was idle, rude, mischievous,
and took the greatest delight in frightening and tormenting
every one about him, particularly his sister
Madeline.</p>

<p>Gustavus, having obtained permission to visit his
uncle and aunt at the hotel, devoted all his leisure
time to them; and being one of the cadets that act as
assistant professors, and are therefore exempt from
military duty, it was in his power to accompany them
on all their walks, and to show them every thing on
West Point worthy the attention of visiters. These
walks would have been delightful, had not Frederick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
caused much annoyance by his vexatious tricks, and
(to use his own expression) by planning frights for
his mother and sister. Reproof affected him only for
a few minutes, and even during their short voyage
in the steam-boat from New-York, his father more
than once regretted that Frederick had not been left
at home.</p>

<p>Their first walk was to Washington's Valley, so
called from having been the head-quarters of the illustrious
commander-in-chief. On their way thither they
visited the German Flats, once the encamping place
of a great number of Hessian deserters, who came
over to the American army while it lay at West Point.
These fields, formerly a desert of stones and weeds,
are now in high cultivation; and at their farthest extremity,
where the wooded heights run out into the
river, is the cemetery, shaded with old cedars, and
ornamented with an elegant monument of white marble,
round which are buried the few cadets that die
here.</p>

<p>The walk from the German Flats to Washington's
Valley, is delightfully cool and shady, being cut
through the forest. The trees meet across the road,
while their tangled roots project in the most fantastic
forms from the banks on each side, and between their
branches are seen at intervals the waters of the Hudson
glittering far below.</p>

<p>The house, for ever memorable as the temporary
residence of Washington, is a mere cottage; but under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
its low roof heroes once met, and plans were discussed,
whose results we are now enjoying. It is surrounded
by locust-trees, at this season resplendent with
their conic clusters of beautiful white blossoms; and
a clear brook murmurs through the garden, seeking
its way to the river, whose waves roll gently in, washing
the smooth grey sand that lies in front of the valley.
Immediately behind this classic spot, ascends
the mountain called the Crow's Nest, the longest and
highest of the chain, that, extending along both shores
of the Hudson, appears to inclose it on every side,
giving it at West Point, the form of a lake from which
there seems to be no outlet. On the opposite, or
northern shore, rise the wild and barren mountains of
Fishkill, far beyond which lie the fertile plains of
Connecticut. Looking up the river, the view is terminated
by the town of Newburgh, at ten miles distance,
with Polipel's Island in front, and a fine range
of country behind; the Chemungo mountains (a
branch of the Catskills) closing the long perspective,
their vast blue forms faintly visible on the remotest
verge of the horizon.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Ormsby, with Gustavus and Madeline,
took their seats on one of the numerous fragments
of rock that are scattered over the sands at
Washington's Valley; and while they were admiring
the prospect, Gustavus (who was skilled in revolutionary
lore) reminded his uncle and aunt, as they
cast their eyes down the river, and looked toward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
plain, of the ball given there by the American officers
to their French companions in arms, in honour of
the birth of the Dauphin. For this purpose, there
was erected on the green an arbour of immense
length, constructed of laurel-branches brought by the
soldiers from the hills. This rustic arcade was illuminated
by a multitude of little tin lamps, which have
been kept ever since in the public store-house, and
which are still used with great pride at the balls given
by the cadets. On this occasion, Washington led off
the first dance with the lady of General Knox.</p>

<p>Frederick, who had no taste for such conversation,
soon rambled away, and amused himself by throwing
stones at some ducks that were paddling in a brook at
the entrance of the woods, returning now and then to
the party at the river side, and soliciting Madeline to
join him.</p>

<p>"I am sure," said he, in a low voice, "you will
find it much more amusing to ramble about with me
than to sit here listening to tales of the old war."</p>

<p>"Indeed," answered Madeline, "I am always glad
to hear as many tales of the old war as I possibly can,
provided that there is nothing in them shocking or
disgusting, and no particulars of the killing; and my
father says that no person of good feelings or good
manners will ever detail the horrors, the real sickening
horrors of a battle, in presence of females. But
I will go with you, if my mother will give me permission."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Mrs. Ormsby's leave was asked and obtained, and
Mr. Ormsby cautioned his children to be absent but
a short time.</p>

<p>Frederick took his sister toward the woods that
stretched down to the water's edge, a little beyond
the cottage, and they were soon out of sight.</p>

<p>In a short time, the little party that remained on
the sands, were alarmed by a succession of violent
shrieks, accompanied by another voice laughing
loudly; and looking up the river, they perceived
Madeline alone in a little boat, drifting out from behind
a projecting point of rock, and evidently in
great terror, while Frederick stood on the shore leaning
against a tree, and ridiculing her fears. They
all ran to her assistance, Gustavus foremost, and
Mr. Ormsby supporting the trembling steps of his
wife.</p>

<p>Suddenly a steam-boat, on her way down from Albany,
came round the stupendous head-land absurdly
called Butter Hill, and emerged into sight with thick
clouds of smoke issuing from her chimneys, her
wheels throwing up volumes of foam, and her prow
dashing aside the water with a velocity that seemed
irresistible. The shrieks of poor Madeline redoubled
when she saw this tremendous machine coming on
with a force that apparently nothing could stop, and
threatening, in a few minutes, to overwhelm her little
boat, unnoticed and unseen. Frederick was now
terrified himself, and he called out to his sister, "Oh!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Madeline, what have I done! The steam-boat will
run over you. She will be upon you in three minutes."</p>

<p>"No, no," exclaimed Gustavus, "do not be frightened,
Madeline. The boat is too far off; there is no
danger." "We will get you immediately out of the
way," cried her father, "but they will see you from
the steam-boat, and avoid passing too near you."
"Where is the rope," asked Gustavus, "by which this
little boat was fastened?" "Here, here," said Frederick,
"round the stump of this old tree. I proposed
to Madeline that we should go and sit in the boat
which we found at the water's edge. And as soon as
I got her in, I thought that just for fun, and to set her
to screaming, I would cut the rope with my knife and
let her float off. I supposed she would drift down to
the place where you were all sitting, and I only
meant to frighten her. I knew that somehow she
could be got out of the boat."</p>

<p>In the mean time, having lengthened the rope by
fastening to it all their pocket handkerchiefs and Mrs.
Ormsby's long shawl, Gustavus took one end in his
hand, (the other being fast to the tree,) and jumping
into the river, swam to the boat, by which means it
was immediately hauled in to the shore, and in a few
moments the affrighted little girl was safe in the arms
of her parents, mingling her tears with those of her
mother.</p>

<p>Mr. Ormsby's indignation was so much excited,
that he declared if there was time to reach the wharf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
before the arrival of the steam-boat, Frederick should
be put on board, and sent immediately down to New
York. This, however, was impossible, the boat being
now close at hand; and as Frederick appeared very
penitent, and made fair promises of never again being
guilty of similar conduct, his father, at the intercession
of Gustavus and Madeline, consented to pardon him,
and for the remainder of the day he behaved perfectly
well.</p>

<p>On the following afternoon, they set out on a walk
in another direction, and Frederick, who had been
very good all the morning, was allowed to accompany
them.</p>

<p>They went first to the Moss House, constructed, at
his leisure hours, by the French cook at the hotel, and
entirely the work of his own hands. He had opened
a path through the thick woods, (hitherto in this place
an impassable wilderness,) and carried it down the
declivity of a craggy hill that descends to the river.
This path, though narrow, steep, and winding, was
neither rugged nor dangerous, and the trees interlacing
their branches, formed an impervious shade across
it. At its termination was a little garden, surrounded
on all sides by a high wall of rough stones piled one
on another, the interstices filled up with earth from
which various wild plants were growing. This wall
was overhung with masses of the forest grape-vine
and other woodland shrubbery. The miniature garden
was laid out in walks and heart-shaped beds, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
planted with flowers, among which were lady-slippers,
pinks, and convolvuluses. In one corner stood
the moss-house, made of cedar branches, trimmed and
cut of even length, filled in between with earth, and
covered all over with a thick coat of the rich and
beautiful moss that abounds in the woods and on the
rocks of West Point. The door was open, and inside
was a sort of settee, also of moss, and a little table
made of twisted vine branches. In the garden near
the house, was another rustic seat, or bench, the back
formed of small boughs, curiously interwoven. Innumerable
birds had taken up their residence near this
charming retreat, and enlivened its dark shades with
their brilliant colours. The oriole darted from tree to
tree with his splendid plumage of orange and black,
the blue-bird fluttered about in azure and purple, the
yellow-hammer far surpassed the tints of the brightest
canary, and the cedar-bird displayed his beautiful pinions
of the richest brown, delicately pencilled at the
edges with lines of fine scarlet, while the little humming-bird
hovered over the flowers, and looked like
a flying gem.</p>

<p>The Ormsby family next visited the monument
erected by the cadets in commemoration of the gallant
Kosciusko, who crossed the Atlantic to take a part in
the American contest for independence, and who afterward
so nobly, but unsuccessfully, defended the rights
of Poland, his own ill-fated country. The monument
is a fluted column of white marble, on a broad pedestal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
simply inscribed with the name of Kosciusko. It
stands near the ruins of Fort Clinton, on the eastern
side of the plain, and on one of the lofty and abrupt
heights that overlook the river.</p>

<p>They then descended to Kosciusko's Garden, a picturesque
retreat half way down the rocks. Here,
while with our army at West Point, the Polish officer
had been accustomed to spend a portion of his leisure
hours; and he had embellished the wild and rugged
spot by planting it with lilacs and rosebushes. The
cadets, with the surplus of the money subscribed by
them for the erection of Kosciusco's monument, have
facilitated the descent to this romantic and interesting
retreat, (which was before almost inaccessible to ladies,)
by causing to be made a long flight of stone
stairs, firm and convenient, but sufficiently rude to be
in unison with the surrounding scenery. These
stairs, winding down between the rocks, lead to a
beautiful grassy platform, backed by a lofty precipice
of granite, which the hand of nature has ornamented
with wild flowers that creep along its ledges, and
shrubs and saplings that grow out from its crevices.
Under a willow which droops on the level beneath, is
a fountain bubbling in a basin of white marble, sculptured
with the name of Kosciusko, and surrounded
with flowering shrubs similar to those planted by the
hero of Poland.</p>

<p>On the northern side of this beautiful spot the rocks
are broken into the most picturesque masses, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
shaded with forest trees of infinite variety; their foliage
at this time displaying the liveliest tints of spring.
The wild grape-vine clasped its crooked and wandering
branches round the mossy stones, and scented the air
with its fragrant blossoms; and the woodland honeysuckle
threw around the sweetest odours from its
clustered flowers of the most delicate pink. In front
a shelf of rock projected over the river, whose clear
blue waters glided far below, reflecting in their calm
mirror "the headlong mountains and the downward
skies." On the opposite shore rose the highlands of
Putnam county; and Gustavus explained to his aunt
and cousins, that in the year 1779, all the heights
nearest the water had been crowned with batteries
and covered with tents, the American army being
encamped on both sides of the river; and that on the
eastern bank, a short distance below West Point, is
the house occupied by the traitor Arnold, and from
which he made his escape when apprised that Washington
was informed of his correspondence with the
British general.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ormsby cast her eyes down the precipice that
impended over the water, and beautiful as it was,
being tufted with shrubs and trees to the very bottom,
she turned away her head, and said it made her dizzy
to look at it. They then sat down on one of the
benches, and Mrs. Ormsby spoke of the strange and
unaccountable fancy, said to be felt by some people,
who, whenever they venture to the verge of a height,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
imagine that they feel an irresistible desire to jump
down. "Mother," said Frederick, advancing to the
edge of the rock "I feel that desire at this moment.
I shall certainly jump in an instant. I shall be down
directly."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ormsby turned pale, and desired Frederick
immediately to come away from the precipice. "My
dear," said Mr. Ormsby, "do you not see the laugh
lurking in Frederick's eye? He only intends to
frighten us. Can you suppose he has really any idea
of leaping from the rock? No, no&mdash;though he delights
in terrifying others, I am well convinced that
he will never do any thing to hurt himself."</p>

<p>Gustavus then told of a soldier's wife, who, a few
years since, (being, as was supposed, in a state of temporary
derangement,) wandered in the night to these
rocks, and falling over the precipice, her mangled
body was discovered next morning, lying almost in
the river.</p>

<p>Our little party then returned to the fountain, and
Gustavus being provided with a leather drinking-cup,
they all tasted the water. They stood there conversing
for a considerable time; and when they turned to
go away, they found that Frederick was not with
them. They looked all around, but he was not to be
seen; and when they called him, there was no answer.
"Where can he be?" exclaimed Mrs. Ormsby,
in much alarm. "I fear he has really fallen down
the rocks. You heard him say that he felt that unaccountable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
inclination we were talking of." "But,"
said Mr. Ormsby, "I did not believe him, and neither
should you. We know Frederick too well."</p>

<p>His father and Gustavus called Frederick loudly,
but no answer was returned, except by the mountain
echoes. The terror of his mother and sister was extreme.
"Frederick!" exclaimed Mr. Ormsby, "Frederick&mdash;you
surely hear us,&mdash;reply immediately."
"Oh! Frederick," cried the mother, "if you really
hear us, answer at once&mdash;put an end to our fears&mdash;how
can you keep us in such agony?" There was
still no reply. "Oh!" exclaimed Mrs. Ormsby, "if
Frederick yet lives, can he allow me to remain in this
dreadful state of fear and suspense? Frederick, Frederick&mdash;this
moment answer your mother!"</p>

<p>Mr. Ormsby's persuasion of Frederick's safety now
began to give way to alarm, and Madeline trembled
and cried. Mrs. Ormsby sunk, nearly fainting, on the
bench; and while her husband brought water from
the fountain and endeavoured to revive her, Gustavus,
who knew every recess of the rocks, explored them in
search of Frederick. He shortly returned, and said
in a low voice, "Compose yourself, dear aunt, I have
just had a glimpse of Frederick. He is safe, and not
near the precipice. He has concealed himself in a sort
of cavity in yon rock near the stairs, though the space
is so small that I wonder how he got into it. He must
have coiled himself up with some difficulty." "Do
not let us go thither to seek him," whispered Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Ormsby. "He shall not have the gratification of
jumping up and laughing at us." Mrs. Ormsby and
Madeline, finding that Frederick was really safe, endeavoured
to calm their agitation; and Mr. Ormsby
and Gustavus began to talk of other things.</p>

<p>After sitting a few minutes longer, "Come," said
Mr. Ormsby, in a loud voice, "we will now return;
and as Frederick's concealment will not produce so
great an effect as he supposes, he may sneak out of
his hole and follow us at his leisure."</p>

<p>They left the bench, and were ascending the lower
flight of stone steps, when a violent scream startled
them all, and it was repeated with sounds of the
most terrible agony. "Those screams are close by,"
exclaimed Madeline. "They came from the place
in which Frederick is hidden," said Gustavus.
"Another of his foolish jokes," said Mr. Ormsby.
"Oh! no, no," cried Mrs. Ormsby, "those are the
screams of real suffering."</p>

<p>Gustavus and Mr. Ormsby then sprung to the cavity
in the rocks, and saw Frederick on the ground, wedged
into a most uncomfortable posture, and sprawling out
his hands with a gesture of the greatest terror, exclaiming,
"Oh! take it off&mdash;take it out&mdash;take it away!"
"Take what?" asked his father. "Oh! the snake&mdash;the
snake!" cried Frederick. "It is crawling down
my back&mdash;it <em>must</em> have a nest in this hole." Gustavus
had by this time got his hand down Frederick's back,
and was feeling for the snake. At last he drew out a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
small lizard, and held it up, to the great relief of
Mrs. Ormsby and Madeline, whose terror had been
nearly equal to Frederick's.</p>

<p>"Let me see it," said Frederick. "Is it really a
lizard? How cold and slippery it felt, and how disagreeably
it crawled down my back." "And you
had not courage," observed his father, "to put your
hand over your shoulder, and take it out, but you lay
there screaming like a baby." "I was afraid it
would bite my hand," said Frederick. "And would
you rather it had bitten your back?" asked Mr. Ormsby.</p>

<p>"It must have fallen upon you accidentally from
the rock above," remarked Gustavus, "and slipped
down your back without intending it, for these animals
are too timid to crawl voluntarily, and in day-time,
over a human being."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Frederick, "I shall be told that
this is a just punishment for frightening my sister yesterday
morning, when I set her adrift in the boat."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly," replied Mr. Ormsby; "and you
have given us another proof that those who find the
greatest pleasure in terrifying others, are, in general,
very easily terrified themselves. To take delight in
giving pain, is cruelty; and courage and cruelty are
rarely found in the same person. However, we will
not have our excursion to West Point spoiled by any
more of your mischievous and unfeeling tricks; therefore
I shall send you down to the city in the first
steam-boat that comes along this evening, and to-morrow
morning you may go to school again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Frederick was much mortified at the punishment in
prospect, and earnestly besought his father to allow
him to remain; but Mr. Ormsby said to him, "The
pain you feel at being sent home, is nothing to that
you caused your mother and sister when you tried to
make them suppose you had fallen down the precipice."</p>

<p>"But I will do these things no more," said Frederick.
"So you said yesterday," replied Mr. Ormsby,
"after cutting the boat adrift with your sister in it."</p>

<p>"Dear father," said Madeline, "did he not suffer
sufficiently for that, when he believed that a snake
was crawling down his back? Pray let him have no
more punishment on that account."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ormsby, who was the fondest of mothers,
now interceded for Frederick, and her husband at last
yielded to her intreaties, and allowed him to remain,
on condition of the best possible behaviour during the
remainder of their stay at West Point.</p>

<p>After stopping on the plain to see the evening
parade of the cadets, and to hear the band, the
Ormsbys returned to the hotel and took tea. The
night being perfectly clear and dry, and the moon at
the full, Gustavus proposed to them a visit by moonlight
to the ruins of Fort Putnam.</p>

<p>Ascending the steep and rocky path that leads up
the side of the mountain, amid the deep shade of the
woods, that resounded with the croak of the tree-frog,
and the rapid and singular cry of the night-hawk&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
emerged into an opening where the moon shone
brightly down, and arrived at the entrance of the
fort&mdash;whose ruins are scattered over a large space of
ground, now covered with grass and wild flowers.
They looked into the arched and gloomy cells which
once served as quarters for the garrison, or receptacles
for military stores; and ascending the eastern rampart
by a few narrow steps of loose and tottering stone,
they looked down upon the whole extent of the plain
lying far below them, with its gardens and houses, on
whose windows the moonbeams glittered; its extreme
point terminating in a ledge of naked rocks, running
far out into the river. They saw a steam-boat coming
down, all cast into shade, except the sheets of flame
that issued from her chimneys, and her three lanterns
sparkling far apart, their brilliant lights reflected on
the water; after turning the point, her form was distinctly
defined, as she crossed the broad line of moonlight
that danced and glittered on the silent river.</p>

<p>Gustavus then conducted his friends to the western
side, where the shattered walls of the old fort run
along the utmost verge of a perpendicular mass of
rock of a stupendous height. Mrs. Ormsby and
Madeline shuddered as they looked over the broken
parapet into the abyss beneath, the bottom of which
is strewed with stones fallen from the lonely ruins;
and Mrs. Ormsby kept Frederick carefully beside
her, and held him tightly by the hand.</p>

<p>Just then the sound of the fifes, and the drums beating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
tattoo, ascended from the plain, and our party returned
to the other side of the fort, that they might
hear it more distinctly. Every note was repeated by
the echoes, and the effect was that of another set of
musicians playing immediately beneath the mountain.
It being now half past nine o'clock, they turned their
steps downward; and after proceeding a little distance
they missed Frederick. "Another of his tricks,"
said Mr. Ormsby, "this time we will take no notice."</p>

<p>As they proceeded they heard the most dismal
groans. "Frederick again," said Mr. Ormsby. "Incorrigible
boy! let us, however, walk on; when he
finds that he has failed to frighten us, we shall soon
see him running down the mountain. Twice in one
day is rather too often to make us believe that he has
fallen down the rocks. I wonder he cannot think of
something new. To-morrow, he shall certainly be
sent home."</p>

<p>They walked on till they reached the foot of the
mountain; Mrs. Ormsby and Madeline again feeling
very apprehensive as to Frederick's safety&mdash;though
Mr. Ormsby said he had no doubt he would soon
overtake them, or that perhaps he would strike into
another road, and be at the hotel as soon as they were.</p>

<p>This, however, did not happen; and after a while,
finding that Frederick did not appear, his father became
really uneasy, and Mrs. Ormsby and Madeline
were exceedingly alarmed. Gustavus had taken a
hasty leave, and left them when they reached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
plain&mdash;being obliged, according to rule, to return to
his room in the barracks before ten o'clock.</p>

<p>Two officers who were at the hotel, volunteered to
assist Mr. Ormsby in searching for his son; and they
went back to Fort Putnam, where, as they approached
the entrance of the ruins, the groans again were heard.
Guided by the sound, they approached the east side of
the parapet; and looking over, perceived something
moving among the branches of a cedar that grew half
way down. "Frederick!" called Mr. Ormsby. This
time he was immediately answered. "Here, here,"
cried Frederick, "I did really fall down this time,
without intending to frighten any body."</p>

<p>They went to him, and found that the cedar tree
had saved his life by catching him among its branches
and holding him there; but that in the fall he had
severely strained his shoulder. The pain, added to
his fright, and to his total want of presence of mind,
had prevented him from trying to get out of the tree;
and he could do nothing but lie there and groan, being
really very much hurt.</p>

<p>He was extricated and put on his feet again, and the
two gentlemen assisted Mr. Ormsby in conveying him
down the mountain. "Now," said his father, "had
you not been so much in the habit of raising false
alarms, we should have stopped at once when we heard
your groans, and had gone in search of you; and
you would not have been obliged to remain so long in
the tree, and to have suffered so much before you could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
be relieved." "Oh!" said Frederick in a piteous
voice, "I feared I should have been obliged to lie
there all night, and perhaps die before any one came
near me. However, it is fortunate I did not fall down
on the side where the precipice is, for I should certainly
have been dashed to pieces among the stones
at the bottom."</p>

<p>When Frederick was brought to the hotel, his
mother and sister were much shocked on finding him
in such a condition. His shoulder was so swelled
that the sleeve of his coat had to be cut open, as it
was impossible for him to draw his arm out of it.
He suffered great pain, and it was a week before he
was well enough to be taken home; during which
time he made many resolutions of amendment.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we have the satisfaction of saying,
that this last lesson was not lost on Frederick Ormsby;
and that he ceased to derive amusement from
exciting pain and terror in others.</p>

<h2>THE RUSTIC WREATH;</h2>

<p class="title1">OR<br />
THE GLEANER.</p>

<p class="center small">BY MRS. HUGHS.</p>

<p>"Come, papa," said Cecilia Beldon, "come and
sit down beside Louisa and me, in this arbour, and
tell us something about England. You have described
St. Paul's Church, Westminster Abbey, Blenheim
Castle, and a great many other fine places; but we
want to hear something that will give us some idea
of the manners of the people, and the impressions
that were made on your mind by the appearance of
the country generally."</p>

<p>"That is a request that I shall be very glad to
comply with to the very best of my power," returned
the father, as he seated himself between his two
daughters, and put an arm round the waist of each;
"but it will not be a very easy task to give you an
idea of scenes so very different from any thing that
you have ever seen."</p>

<p>"Well, try at any rate, papa," said Louisa; "describe
things as well as you can, and we shall, at all
events, get a few ideas, though they may not, perhaps,
be equal to the reality."</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
"True. Then to begin. It was the middle of
September when I landed in England; but unless you
had experienced the monotony of a sea voyage, you
could form little conception of the pleasure with which
I exchanged the continuous prospect of the 'dark blue
wave' of the Atlantic, for the bright and gay scenes
which England presented. You know I had left our
own dear land at a time when, of all others, it appears
to the least advantage; for the fervid heats of a July
sun had scorched every blade of grass, and a long and
distressing drought had given an almost autumnal tint
to the foliage of the trees. The few inhabitants, too,
that remained in the city, looked pale and languid,
and crept along the streets as if deprived of all the
energy that was requisite for the performance of the
business of life, and wishing for nothing so much as a
comfortable place, to rest on the brow of some mountain,
and a portion of Rip Van Winkle's power of
forgetfulness, that they might sleep away the sultry
hours, till the moderated sun, the cool and bracing
nights, and the clear pure air of the autumnal months,
should again give life a zest. But when I arrived in
England, all was life, activity and bustle in the towns;
the people were fresh, ruddy, and animated; while
the humidity of the atmosphere had preserved the
bright tints of vernal beauty over the country. Few
things in the world, perhaps, present a more strikingly
beautiful picture to the eye than an English landscape.
The graceful undulations of the country&mdash;the deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
rich verdure that overspreads the ground&mdash;the high
cultivation that every where meets the eye, and speaks
of industry and wealth&mdash;the gothic edifices, telling
tales of former times&mdash;the country seats, which display
at once the elegance and taste of their inhabitants;
and above all, the neat cottages, which impart a truth
most delightful to the benevolent heart, that comfort,
and a considerable portion of refinement, are enjoyed
by even the lowest ranks, are all points of beauty
which are particularly striking to an American traveller;
for they unfold a train of new ideas to his mind,
and he at once realizes all the fairy pictures, the outlines
alone, of which, he had before been able to trace;
and for the first time in his life, he becomes fully sensible
of the magic of Shakespeare, the richness of
Thomson, and the graphic paintings of Cunningham.
Nor did I find the English people less interesting than
the landscape. My letters of introduction placed me,
at once, in the most delightful society, where, if it
had not been for the little girls whom I had left behind
me," added the father, as he pressed his daughters
closer to him, "I might have been in danger of
forgetting that I was not at home."</p>

<p>"But I always understood, papa," interrupted Cecilia,
"that the English were exceedingly cold and
reserved in their manners."</p>

<p>"They have that character amongst their neighbours,
the French, who, you know, carry their ideas
of politeness to perhaps rather an extravagant height;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
but such they did not appear to me; nor have I ever
met with an American traveller, that had had an opportunity
of seeing English domestic manners, who
did not bear willing testimony to their frankness, refinement,
and hospitality; indeed, there is a cordiality
in their manner of receiving a stranger, that is an
irresistible evidence of their sincerity.</p>

<p>"A gentleman, in whose house I became early familiar,
told me one day that he was going to take his
wife and children the following morning to have a
day's ramble in the country, and kindly invited me to
occupy a seat in one of the carriages; and you may
be sure I was much pleased with the opportunity of
peeping at the beauties of nature, amongst a happy
group of children, some of whom, from a similarity
of age, as well as other circumstances, often reminded
me of yourselves.</p>

<p>"For the first half hour after we had set out on
our little journey, the presence of the 'American
gentleman' rather checked that buoyancy of spirit,
which the suppressed smile, the half whisper, and the
side glance showed was waiting only for a little better
acquaintance, to burst out with the most frolic
gayety; nor was it long before a few well-timed inquiries,
and a happily applied anecdote or two relative
to the scenes of this country, removed the embargo
under which their little tongues had lain, and in a
short time, their mother and I became the listeners,
instead of the talkers, of the company."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
"This is the birth-day of these two," said the
mother, who seemed, at length, to feel it necessary to
make some apology for the volubility of the party,
and pointing, as she spoke, to two lovely little girls,
who were twins, "and as this treat is given on the
occasion, their father and myself are disposed to
make it as complete as possible, by allowing the
whole party unrestrained indulgence in the pleasures
of talking; an enjoyment, which, I suppose, as you
have children of your own, you can form some idea of."</p>

<p>"Are your daughters fond of talking?" asked a fine,
open-countenanced girl, about ten years old.</p>

<p>"They are, indeed. They will not yield the palm
even to you, in that respect, I assure you."</p>

<p>"I should like to see them. Why did you not
bring them with you?" asked another.</p>

<p>"If they were here," said one of the little twins,
"I would give them some of my pretty flowers. Are
they fond of flowers?"</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly; but they have not an opportunity
of cultivating them so much as you do here, for the
excessive heat of our summers, and the severity of
our winters, are particularly unfavourable to flowers.
Besides, you must know, my little girl, that mine is a
very young country, and my countrymen have hitherto
been too busy in draining marshes, felling forests,
and extending the boundaries of civilization and
government, to think much of what is purely ornamental."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>"How can America be a young country, mamma?"
asked the other twin sister. "I thought the world
had all been created at one time."</p>

<p>"Julia, can you explain that difficulty to your sister?"
asked their mother, of one of her elder
daughters.</p>

<p>"I suppose," replied Julia, colouring at being thus
called upon, yet speaking without hesitation or awkwardness,
"the reason of America being called a
young country, is because it is only about three
hundred years since it was discovered by Columbus;
and before that time, it was only inhabited by savages,
who knew nothing of building houses, or cultivating
the ground, or any of those things."</p>

<p>"We had a great deal of conversation of this kind,
which proved the children to be both intelligent, and
accustomed to think and inquire for themselves; and
the time went over so pleasantly, that I was quite surprised
when the stopping of the carriage announced
the termination of our ride. The farm house, at
which we stopped, was a neat, substantially built stone
house, with a pretty green, enclosed by well painted
white rails in front, and a large garden at one side,
surrounded by the same kind of enclosure, and proving,
by its clean walks, its neat well weeded beds, and
the variety of flowers and vegetables which flourished
in it, that horticulture was considered a part of the
owner's business. Though we arrived early, the cattle,
which had been collected for the purpose of being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
milked, in the neat well paved farm yard, were already
dispersed, the business of the dairy despatched,
and the cheese made; but we were just in time to
see the wholesome breakfast of bread and cheese
and milk, set out for the troop of reapers, whom we
saw in the distance, following each other with beautiful
regularity, cutting down the ripened grain, and
binding up the sheaves. On the summons for breakfast
being given, the whole group, with good humoured,
though noisy hilarity, hastened to the house; and
I, whilst astonished at their number, which was so
much greater than I had ever seen engaged in a similar
way at home, was amused with the variety of
young and old, grave and gay, and male and female,
which it exhibited. I was surprised, however, to find,
that even after the reapers were all assembled round
the breakfast table, the field which they had left was
still covered over with a great many stragglers, who
appeared to wander about without any definite object
in view, whilst the master, with his stick thrown over
his shoulder, strolled about amongst them, as if his
work was not yet suspended. Upon inquiry, I found
that these were gleaners, a race of beings of whom
we know nothing in this country, except through the
poets; and my imagination instantly taking flight at
the name, I hastened to the field, not doubting that I
should find a Ruth, or a Lavinia, to fill the only corner
that was now vacant of the brilliant picture before me.
For a long time, however, creeping age, and infant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
hands, were the only objects which met my view, and
I was about to leave the field, disappointed that no
'form fresher than the morning rose' had met my
view, when, turning to a remote corner, a being attracted
my attention, whose loveliness would require
the pen of a Thomson to describe. It was a young
female, who had laid an infant, of which she was evidently
the youthful mother, upon the bundle of corn
which she had just gathered, and left it under the protection
of a faithful guardian, a large dog, which still
kept watch by its side. I conjectured, that the infant
had been asleep when first laid there, but it was now
awake, and was tossing about its little hands and feet,
and crowing in great glee, highly delighted with a
flower that it had accidentally caught in its little hand.
The mother had, probably, come when the reapers
left the field, to take her breakfast of bread and milk,
which was in a basket near her, as well as to look
after the safety of her child; and finding it so happy
on its rural bed, she had allowed it to remain there,
whilst she, with a mother's vanity, amused herself
with ornamenting its little hat with some of the ears of
corn that she had just gathered. I do not know that
even Thomson would have described her as beautiful,
though certainly, 'a native grace sat fair proportioned
on her polished limbs,' and the sweet expression of
maternal tenderness, which beamed from her eye, and
illumined her whole countenance, would have afforded
ample scope to his descriptive powers. I stood riveted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
to the spot, and gazed on this interesting young creature
and her child, both as lovely as poet's dream, or
the flower that the traveller sees springing from the
arid sand of the desert. I took my pencil and endeavoured
to sketch the group, with the farm house
and the village spire in the distance; not however, for
myself, for the picture rests on my mind in more vivid
colours than ever were spread on painter's palette, but
with the hope of giving you some faint idea of the
loveliness that had so much seized my own fancy."</p>

<p>"Ah, papa," said Louisa, archly, "I see, though
you are always so anxious to keep us from setting
much value on personal beauty, that you admire it as
much yourself as any body does."</p>

<p>"You must remember, however, Louisa," returned
her father, "that what I have spoken of, is that most
delightful species of beauty which is expressive of
high moral qualities; and this depends not on regularity
of feature, or perfection of form, but on that
which is infinitely superior to both, good and amiable
dispositions. Where the mind is pure, the thoughts
elevated, and the sentiments liberal and kind, a pleasing
expression will be found to pervade the most rugged
set of features that were ever bestowed upon a
human being. Besides, this species of beauty is highly
improvable, for as the mind becomes cultivated&mdash;as
it takes a wider range among the works of nature,
and a deeper interest in the happiness of its fellow-beings,
and the cultivation of its own powers, the expression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
of the face will become more refined and elevated.
The chief beauty which struck me in the English
gleaner, was that of expression, the expression of
a kind and amiable heart, and the light of moral
goodness illumined her countenance: and it is that
species of beauty alone, my dear children, for which
I am anxious to see you conspicuous."</p>

<p>"But, papa!" exclaimed both the sisters at once,
as their father now rose from his seat, "you must
not leave us so soon, we have not heard half enough
about England yet."</p>

<p>"I have spent as much time with you as I can
spare at present, but will take an early opportunity of
indulging myself in retracing some more English
scenes, many of which were as new, though few
more interesting than the Gleaner."</p>

<p>"Will you come to our house, and help Jenny,
for my mother is very ill?" said a little girl, in the
feeble accents of childhood, whilst she knocked at the
door of a cottage. The voice was weak, but it uttered
tones, which, though they may sometimes be
heard with indifference by the inmates of a palace,
never fail to find a ready way to the heart of the humble
cottager. "What sound is that I hear?" said
the mistress of the lowly dwelling, as the voice of
the child roused her from a sound sleep; "was I
dreaming? or did I really hear a voice?"</p>

<p>"Will you come to my mother, for Jenny thinks
she is dying?" continued the little girl, as she again
applied her hand to the door. Convinced now that it
was no dream, the benevolent cottager started from
her bed, and opening the door, exclaimed in a tone
of surprise, "Why, Sally, is that you?&mdash;Here, all
by yourself, in the very dead of night!"</p>

<p>"My mother is so ill that Jenny could not leave her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
and she had nobody else to send to ask you to come
and help her."</p>

<p>"Come John, get up directly!" said the woman,
rousing her husband, who under the influence of a
previous day of hard labour, had slept too soundly to
hear what passed. "Get up! for you will very likely
have to go for the doctor. And come in, Sally
dear, till I get something on me, and I will go with
you in a minute."</p>

<p>Very little preparation was necessary, and in a few
minutes the kind hearted woman hastened to the house
of sickness, accompanied by the little girl, and followed
by her husband, who though no less willing, was
much less able to throw off the lethargic influence of
sleep, and trudged after the nimble feet of his wife as
if scarcely conscious whither he was going. As the
distance was very short, he had no time to get fully
awake, before the little Sally opened the door of her
mother's house and ushered himself and his wife in;
but on entering, a sight presented itself to their view
that instantly roused every feeling of the soul to pity
and commiseration. On a humble bed, in the corner
of a very humble apartment, lay stretched the form of
her to whose assistance they had been summoned;
not, however, either writhing with pain or burning
with fever, but cold, stiff, and lifeless; whilst a bowl
stood near, which told at once, by its contents, that the
rupture of a blood vessel had produced the sad catastrophe.
By the side of the bed knelt her daughter, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
girl about sixteen, who, "struck with sad anguish at
the stern decree," seemed to retain little more of life
than the corpse, the hand of which she grasped between
hers, whilst her eyes were riveted on the motionless
face, with an expression of the most heartrending
agony. Grief wears a variety of forms, according
to the nature of the mind of which it takes
possession; but it assumes no appearance that imparts
so immediate a sense of its intensity to the heart of
the spectator, as that silent and speechless sorrow that
finds no relief from utterance. In vain did the benevolent
neighbours endeavour to rouse the poor girl from
her trance of wo; the stroke had been so sudden, so
unlooked-for, and was so appalling in its nature, that
poor Jenny, though she had been long familiar with
adversity, seemed ready to sink under it, without a
single effort to resist its overpowering influence.</p>

<p>"Jenny! dear Jenny! don't take on this way!"
said the humane neighbour, whilst her husband raised
the almost insensible girl from her kneeling posture
by the bed-side, and placed her on a chair. The
little Sally imagining, from the stillness that prevailed,
that her mother had fallen asleep, had kept at a distance
from the bed-side, lest she should by any means
disturb her; but now beginning to wonder why her
sister should thus be the chief object of anxiety, she
had crept softly forward to investigate the cause, and
set her eyes, for the first time in her life, on the features
of death. The sudden cry which she gave, was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
first sound that reached the heart of the grief-stricken
Jenny; and as the weeping child ran toward her,
she opened her arms, and clasping her to her bosom,
wept over her in all the luxury of sorrow. Her
compassionate neighbours knew enough of the human
heart, to judge it best to leave her to herself;
and, therefore, summoning some other of their friends
to their assistance, they busied themselves about the
various offices for the dead, and left poor Jenny to
the undisturbed indulgence of her wo. But Jenny's
grief was too intense to allow her long the relief of
tears, and she sat, almost motionless, clasping the little
Sally in her arms, who had soon wept herself to
sleep, and waited till she was permitted again to
throw herself by the side of her lifeless parent, and
watch over the remains of what she had so fondly
loved. This indulgence was all that she desired, and
all of which she was capable of partaking; and she
sat watching the body almost without either speaking,
or moving, till the moment arrived when it was
to be deposited in its last silent mansion. Then it
was, that the poor girl felt that she had indeed lost
her beloved parent for ever. Whilst the lineaments
still remained before her view, on which she had so
long delighted to gaze, even though they were cold
and motionless, she felt as though she had still something
to rest upon; but when these too were taken
away, when the very shell which the soul of affection
had once inhabited, was removed from a world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
in which she herself was still to remain, she, for the
first time, became sensible of that total destitution of
soul that is felt after the loss of those we love. Happily,
however, for poor Jenny, she was forbidden, by
the calls of imperative necessity, to indulge in unavailing
sorrow; and the exertions that her forlorn
situation demanded, proved the most effectual balm
to her wounded bosom; and gradually, a meek submission
to the will of Him to whom she had been
taught from her earliest infancy to bow in humble
confidence, superseded that bitter anguish which had
at first swelled her heart almost to bursting.</p>

<p>The parent, whom Jenny so deeply mourned, had
been left a widow some months before the little Sally
was born. She had two children then living; Jenny,
who was at that time about nine years old, and a boy,
five years her senior. The mother had, before her
marriage, been an upper servant in a genteel and respectable
family, and had acquired, in consequence,
a degree of cultivation superior to the situation in
which her marriage afterwards placed her. The
chief ambition of her heart was to keep her children
under her own eye, and to train their infant minds to
religion and virtue. But William, her boy, who was
fourteen at the time of his father's death, soon began
to be anxious to do something for himself; and, as
the surest and shortest means of attaining that desirable
end, he had fixed his mind upon the sea. In
vain did his mother remind him that the salt wave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
had been the grave of his father, or endeavour to
impress upon his mind the many anxious days and
sleepless nights he would thus impose upon her; he
saw no other means half so likely to enable him, in
the course of a few years, to provide for her and his
sisters, and to relieve her delicate frame from the
hardship, which it was so ill calculated to bear, of
labouring for their subsistence. "Besides, mother,"
remonstrated he, "I have no other chance of seeing
the world, but by being a sailor, and I could never be
happy without seeing some of the strange countries
that my father used to tell me about. And you know,
too," continued the generous boy, looking as he
spoke, at his elder sister, to whom he was exceedingly
attached, "by the time that I am out of my apprenticeship,
Jenny will be almost grown up, and
with the wages I can then earn, and your good management,
we shall be able to give her some good
schooling, and keep her at home with you; for she
is too pretty and too delicate to go to service."
Jenny was indeed beautiful, even at that early age,
and every year, as it added to her height, increased
also the grace and loveliness of her form. Her features
were regular, her complexion not only fair but
almost transparent, while her bright auburn locks
hung in luxuriance about her face and shoulders.
But it was not in the symmetry of feature or the
grace of form, that Jenny's beauty was centered. It
was the inward harmony which presided over all,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
and gave to her full blue eyes an expression of the
most touching sensibility, that made her an object so
delightful to look upon: and her mother felt, as she
gazed upon her, that she must perform her own duties
ill indeed, if, even without any higher advantages
of education than she could herself give her, the
lovely bud, as it expanded into maturity, did not become
a flower worthy of being transplanted into the
most highly cultivated garden.</p>

<p>William went to sea, and his mother had all the
satisfaction that a mother's heart can enjoy, of hearing
his master express, at every return of the vessel,
the highest approbation of his conduct. Thus supported
and comforted by her children, she laboured
incessantly but cheerfully for her own and their support,
at first as a seamstress; but this sedentary occupation
being unfavourable to her constitution, she afterward
rented a small cottage to which was attached
a garden of considerable extent, which Jenny and
she managed to cultivate themselves, with the aid of
very little hired assistance; and, from the sale of the
produce, she contrived to make a scanty but respectable
livelihood. Time thus rolled on, Jenny had
completed her thirteenth year, and her William was
within a few weeks of being out of his time. But
alas! William was away, and many weeks, nay
months, had passed over without his having been
heard of. Again and again, had she gone to the
owners to inquire after him, but in vain; no tidings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
had been received of the vessel since she had left
the port at which she had taken in her lading, and
had sailed homeward bound; and though the usual
length of the passage was that of two or three
weeks at furthest, above thrice that number had
elapsed without any tidings of her having been received.</p>

<p>The poor widow had, on the evening previous to
her death, again been at the owner's on the mournful
errand of inquiring after her lost boy, and had
again returned disappointed and dejected. She had,
on her way thither, been overtaken by a heavy
shower of rain, which had wet her clothes quite
through. She had paid no attention, however, to the
circumstance; for her mind was engrossed with the
thought of her child, and though Jenny, on her return
home, used every means in her power to prevent
her taking harm from it, a cough, to which she
had always been subject, and which at that time was
worse than usual, soon showed how much injury she
had received. In a violent paroxysm of coughing,
she had ruptured the blood-vessel that put so sudden
a period to her existence, and left poor Jenny alone
and destitute in the world,&mdash;alone except the little
helpless being, whose dependence upon her seemed
only to make her situation still more deplorable.
Jenny's mind, however, was one of those which,
though tuned to every gentle feeling, yet possessed
a native strength which rose in proportion to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
pressure of misfortune; so that, as she looked upon
little Sally, and considered that she was now, in all
probability, her only earthly protector, she felt a tenderness
almost parental rise within her, and she determined
to resist every inclination to selfish indulgence
of her feelings, and exert every energy for the
support of her little orphan sister,&mdash;the posthumous
heir of poverty and sorrow. But let not those who
are surrounded by plenty, even though mourning the
loss of some beloved relative, imagine that they know
the difficulties of the task that poor Jenny had to
perform; nor yet those who though pressed by the
hard gripe of poverty, have yet some remaining
friends from whom they have a right to claim the
tender balm of sympathy; for of these comforts
poor Jenny was equally destitute, and she found herself
standing alone in the wide world, poor, friendless,
and forlorn; deprived of "every stay save innocence
and Heaven." It is true, some faint hope
still played about her heart, that her beloved brother&mdash;her
kind, her affectionate William, might yet be
restored to her; but every day, as it passed over her
head, made that hope more faint, till, like the hues
of its own bow, which gradually fade into ether, it
died away by degrees in her bosom; and at length
scarce a tint remained to give its colouring to the
mental horizon. Still, however, she bore up and
struggled against the despondency that threatened to
lay hold of her mind; and even though grim want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
seemed ready to stare her in the face, her steadfast
spirit, relying upon the goodness of that superintending
Power, that is ever ready to be a father to the
fatherless, looked up to heaven with a confident hope
that she would not be forgotten. "Will He," she
would say, as she watched the fruit ripen, or the seed
germinate, "will He who takes care of all these
things and gives them the nourishment which they
require, turn a deaf ear to the cry of his orphan children?
It cannot be! That little bird," she continued,
"is pouring forth its soul in thankfulness and joy,
though it has no stores laid up for to-morrow, and I
too will trust to the same protecting Power." But
from what source to-morrow's fare was to be derived,
poor Jenny could form but little idea. Autumn was
now far advanced, and the produce of their garden
had become very scanty, whilst the expenses attendant
on her mother's funeral had entirely exhausted
their small store of money; so that when the little
Sally complained of hunger, and begged that she
would give her something to eat, she put the last
morsel of bread into her hands, totally at a loss to
conjecture whence the money was to be derived that
was to purchase more. "Why will you not eat any
yourself, Jenny?" said the child, as she eagerly devoured
the dry morsel. "I am sure you must be
hungry, for I have not seen you eat any thing to-day."
"I do not want to eat," replied Jenny, forcing
herself to speak in a cheerful tone, though she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
felt at the same moment that the coarsest food would
be to her a most delicious repast. "Is it because
there is no more in the house?" asked Sally, whose
mind, for the first time, received the idea of their
scanty provision. Jenny was silent. "There is
more bread here than I want," said the child, breaking,
as she spoke, the piece of bread that she had
before declared was not half so much as she could
eat. "Take this piece, Jenny, I don't want it, and I
am sure you will like it after you have tasted it."</p>

<p>Jenny had watched, with a dry eye, her little sister
devouring their last morsel of food, whilst she herself
was suffering under the most importunate demands of
hunger; but this tender sympathy in the child, and
her willingness to give up a part of what she so much
needed herself, brought a flood of tears to her eyes.
"He, who feeds the young ravens when they cry
cannot let such sweetness and innocence suffer for
want of food," said she inwardly, as clasping the
child in her arms, she bathed her cheeks with her
tears. "Don't cry, Jenny," said the affectionate little
girl, as she wiped the tears from her sister's eyes
with her little apron. "Don't cry. Indeed I don't
want any more just now, and I dare say you will get
another loaf before I am hungry again. And who-knows
but William may come back, and then we shall
have every thing that we want? You have not been
at the owner's lately, Jenny, to ask about the ship,"
continued the child, anxious to divert her sister's mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
from the sad subject of her reflections. "Why don't
you go, Jenny?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid there is little use in it," answered
her sister in a tone of despondency.</p>

<p>"But try, Jenny, just try once more, and perhaps
good news may come when you are not expecting
it."</p>

<p>"Well, we will go now," returned Jenny; "and,"
added she, "there are a few plums on the old tree
that we will take with us, though they are not half
ripe yet; and perhaps we may get somebody to give
us as much for them as will get bread enough to
keep us from starving at least one day longer." A
little basket was soon filled with the plums, and they
set out, once more cheered by that hope which seldom
totally forsakes the bosom of youth and innocence:
but, on arriving at the owner's, Jenny was
surprised to find all in a state of confusion. The
servant that came to the door was evidently much
agitated, and on Jenny's making her accustomed inquiry
if any thing had yet been heard of the ship,
she was told by the girl that a letter had, a very short
time before, been received by her mistress, informing
her that some wrecks of the vessel had been cast
ashore, and some of the sailors' chests, among which
was one bearing the name of William Anderson;
and that there was every reason to believe that all
the crew were lost. Here then was a fatal blow to
all the fond hopes that Jenny had so anxiously cherished;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
and her affectionate brother, on whom she
had relied for support and consolation in the hour of
affliction, had himself found a premature and watery
grave. The servant's sympathy was too powerfully
excited for the distress of her mistress, whose husband
had filled the double station of master and
owner, to leave much to bestow upon poor Jenny;
so that, after giving her all the information in her
power, she turned from the door, leaving the two orphan
sisters to themselves to mourn over their share
of this heavy calamity. Jenny turned her steps
homeward, with a heart bowed down with affliction,
and was only made conscious of where she was and
whither she was going, by the questions that Sally
occasionally put to her. "Look at that black cloud,
Jenny," said the child, "I never saw such a cloud
before. Do you think we can get home before the
rain comes on?" Jenny looked up and saw that the
sky had indeed a most portentous aspect; but the
gloom that surrounded her only seemed to be in unison
with the state of her mind, and she almost felt rejoiced
that nature did not wear the appearance of
gladness, whilst she felt that all was darkness within.
"Isn't that thunder?" asked Sally, as a deep
and distant murmur rolled round the horizon. "And
there is lightning, and there is another flash," continued
the child; "Oh! I wish we were at home."
Jenny saw the lightning and heard the thunder, but
she heard and saw almost without being conscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
that she did either; for her mind was absorbed in
the idea of her beloved brother having been exposed
to a storm, such as that which was approaching, accompanied
with the additional horrors of a tempestuous
ocean. A violent gust of wind now swept past
them, and the thunder which, only a moment before,
had rolled at a distance, burst over their heads with
a noise which seemed to shake the very ground on
which they stood; whilst the clouds brooded around
in almost midnight darkness, or only parted to emit
flashes of lightning, that, for the instant, illumined
every object.</p>

<p>"Oh! Jenny, what must we do?" cried the little
Sally, shrinking with fear, and putting her hands to
her ears to shut out the noise of the thunder. Jenny
put her arm round the neck of the child, and pressed
her tenderly toward her, as, looking up at the forked
shafts which flew across the skies, she inwardly
breathed the prayer that he who rolls the thunderbolt
and sends the lightning forth, if it was his pleasure
that they should either of them fall beneath the stroke,
would in his mercy let them sink together; and not
leave one remaining, the helpless or wretched survivor
of the other.</p>

<p>Jenny perhaps never looked more beautiful or interesting
than she did at that moment, as she stood
turning her back to a storm which she no longer felt
the power to resist, her arm passed with an almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
maternal tenderness round the neck of her orphan
sister, who seemed to rest against her as if assured
that she was under the care of a protecting angel;
and her fine eyes raised to heaven with a mingled
expression of steadfast faith and humble submission.
"My mother! my dear William!" she faintly uttered,
"perhaps these shafts of lightning are sent as
the messengers of our re-union." As she said this, a
voice seemed to be borne along on the wind, and she
almost fancied that she heard her own name pronounced.
"It is a wild thought," she continued internally,
"but I could almost imagine that William's
voice is in the wind, and that he is calling me to join
him and our blessed mother in the regions above."
Again the voice sounded in her ear, and again, and
again&mdash;it grew louder and more distinct&mdash;what could
it mean? Was she already in the region of spirits?
or were those angelic beings really permitted, as has
sometimes been imagined, to revisit this world and
hover over those whom they had loved on earth?
As she asked herself the question, she turned round,
but what words can express her feelings when, on
doing so, she beheld, hastening toward her with all
the speed that the violence of the storm would permit,
the beloved brother whom she had believed to
be the inmate of a watery grave! Her mind had
been strung to too high a degree of agony, and she
was too much exhausted from the want of food, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
bear this sudden revulsion of feeling without sinking
under it. She uttered a scream, and made an attempt
to rush forward, but her limbs became powerless,
a film came over her eyes, and she would have
sunk on the ground, had not William reached her in
time to receive her in his arms. So deep was the
swoon into which she had fallen, that there was time
for her to be conveyed to a house that was at no very
great distance, before her consciousness again returned
to her. When it did, she started up, and looked
eagerly around, as if to assure herself that the object
she had seen had not been a mere vision of the
imagination; but she was soon convinced of the happy
reality, for her eye immediately rested on her beloved
William as he stood trying to still the cries of
the little Sally, who could not be convinced that the
insensible state in which Jenny lay was not equally
hopeless as that which she had first witnessed at the
time of her mother's death.</p>

<p>A copious flood of tears now came to Jenny's relief,
which she was permitted to indulge for a considerable
time without interruption, and then her brother
led her gradually on to speak of their mother, and
describe the particulars of a death of which little
Sally had already informed him; after which, he
proceeded to satisfy her curiosity respecting himself.
It appeared that a long continuation of high and contrary
winds had kept the vessel buffeting about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
ocean for many weeks, till at length a storm, too powerful
to be resisted, had driven her on the coast, where
she soon became a total wreck. Happily for William,
however, he had been so fortunate as not only
to save his own life, but that of his captain also, who
had become so completely benumbed with cold and
long exposure to the storm, as to be totally incapable
of assisting himself, and must have been an unresisting
prey to the angry waves, had not the generous
youth determined to try to save him, even at the most
imminent hazard of his own life. After many difficulties
and dangers, he succeeded in gaining a footing
on shore for both his captain and himself, but it
was a considerable time before the former was able
to proceed homeward; but when he was, they hastened
on in the hope of preceding the news of their
misfortunes. The letter, however, giving an account
of the portions of the wreck which had been washed
on shore, on a part of the coast at some distance from
that on which they had landed, had arrived a short
time before them; indeed, they had reached the captain's
house only a very few minutes after Jenny and
her little sister had left it, and William had lost no
time in hastening after them. "We have weathered
a heavy gale," said he, after he had given his sisters
this account, "but it is all over now; and what is
better, our captain declares he will never go to sea
again, but will give me the command of the new vessel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
which he is going to have built. He says that I
saved his life, and he is determined to prove a father
to me in return."</p>

<p>"Oh! my mother," cried Jenny, clasping her
hands and raising her eyes in thankfulness to
Heaven, "why are you not here to enjoy this happy
moment!"</p>

<p>"And why should you not, my dear girl," said the
lady into whose house Jenny had been carried, and
who had listened with great interest to the conversation
between the brother and sister; "why should
you not believe not only that she sympathizes in your
happiness, but that her views of the great scheme of
Providence are now so enlarged, as to render her
capable of perceiving that, what we here call evils,
are as mere motes in the balance, when put in competition
with the great sum of happiness which awaits
the virtuous hereafter? Upon the benevolent plan
on which all creation is formed, the petty distinctions
of rich and poor, high and low, on which we are apt
to place so much importance, will soon be lost in the
grand and comprehensive distinctions of virtue and
vice; to which standard alone, all will be brought,
and which may at once place the humblest peasant
above the proudest monarch."</p>

<p>"Yes! yes! Jenny," said the young sailor, "we
know that whatever storms may beset us, we still
have a never-failing Friend, always at hand, who will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
steer us to a safe harbour at last. So come, my
sweet lilly and my pretty rose-bud," added he, taking
a hand of each of his sisters, "cheer up, my
girls! for, though the winds still blow and the skies
frown, by the blasts of poverty, at least, you shall
never more be assailed, as long as your brother's arm
has power to protect you."</p>

<h2>THE MYSTERIOUS PICTURE.</h2>

<p class="center small">TRANSLATED FROM THE FRENCH.</p>

<p class="hanging">The following extraordinary story is declared by the authoress, Mademoiselle
Vanhove, to be strictly true in its leading incidents.</p>

<p>Madame Dorival was the widow of a distinguished
French officer, who had died in the service of his
country. Finding it difficult, without the closest economy,
to support her family genteelly on the pension
allowed her by government, and being anxious to
secure an independence for her children in case of
her death, she was induced to open a boarding-school
in the vicinity of Paris. The assistance of her two
highly accomplished daughters, Lucilla and Julia,
made the employment of female teachers unnecessary;
but she engaged the best masters for music,
dancing, drawing and painting, and the fashionable
foreign languages. Her establishment was conducted
on a most liberal scale, and each of the twenty
young ladies who became her pupils had a separate
apartment.</p>

<p>Among these young ladies, was Josephine Vericour,
who took lessons in miniature painting, with the view
of exercising that branch of the art as a profession;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
the circumstances of her family being such that it
was necessary to educate her, in the prospect of
turning her talents to a profitable account.</p>

<p>Her imagination being deeply impressed with this
object, she thought of it nearly all day, and dreamed
of it at night. That she had much natural talent for
drawing, was unquestionable; but she was only fifteen,
she was not a prodigy, and in every thing she
had as yet produced was to be found a due portion of
errors and defects. With an ardent ambition to excel,
Josephine was the victim of a painful and unconquerable
timidity, and an entire want of confidence in
herself. She had attempted likenesses of all her
school-mates, one after another, and was disheartened
and discouraged because none of them were perfect,
and was overwhelmed with mortification when she
heard them criticised. The remarks of the gentleman
who instructed her, though very judicious, were
often so severe, that she was frequently almost
tempted to throw away her pencil in despair, and she
never painted worse than when under the eye of her
master.</p>

<p>One morning in the garden, she was struck with
the graceful and picturesque attitude in which two of
her companions had unconsciously thrown themselves,
one of them, having put her arm round the waist of
the other, was pointing out to her notice a beautiful
butterfly that had just settled on a rose. Josephine
begged of the girls to remain in that position while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
she sketched them on the blank leaf of a book.
Afterwards she made a separate drawing of each of
their faces, and then transferred the whole to a large
sheet of ivory, intending to make a picture of it in the
miniature style. But she determined to work at it in
her own chamber, at leisure hours, and not to allow
it to be seen till it was entirely finished. In six
weeks there was to be a private examination, at which
premiums were to be awarded to those who excelled
in the different branches taught at Madame Dorival's
school. Seven of the young ladies were taking
lessons in miniature-painting, all of whom, in the eyes
of the diffident Josephine, possessed far more talent
than herself. Still, she knew that industry, application,
and an ardent desire to succeed, had often effected
wonders; and she was extremely anxious to gratify
her parents by obtaining the prize, if possible.</p>

<p>In the retirement of her own room she painted with
unremitting solicitude, but, as <em>she</em> thought, with very
indifferent success; and one afternoon, more dissatisfied
than usual with the result of her work, she
hastily took the ivory from her little easel, and put it
into the drawer of her colour-box, which she consigned
to its usual place in the drawer of her table.</p>

<p>Next morning, what was the surprise of Josephine,
to find her picture standing against the easel on the
table, and much farther advanced than when she had
quitted it the preceding evening, and the faults which
had then discouraged her, entirely rectified. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
tried to recollect if she had really put away the picture,
and her memory recalled every circumstance
of her shutting it up in the drawer. But she had no
recollection of having previously corrected any of
the errors; indeed, she knew that she had not, and
the only way in which she could attempt to solve the
mystery, was to suppose that some one, with the intention
of exciting a laugh at her expense, had come
into her room during the night, taken out the picture,
and re-touched it.</p>

<p>She mentioned it to no one; but the next night,
to guard against a recurrence of the same trick, she
arranged every thing in the neatest order, locked up
her picture in the secret drawer at the bottom of her
colour-box, and placed it under her bolster.</p>

<p>But her astonishment was redoubled, when awaking
at an early hour the next morning, she put her hand
under the bolster to feel for her box and found it
gone! She ran to the table, and saw there the colour-box
lying beside the picture, which, as before, was
leaning against the easel, and evidently much improved.
She thought that it now began to look beautifully,
and she could not withdraw her delighted eyes
from contemplating it.</p>

<p>Still she felt persuaded that it was all a trick, for
which she should pay dearly when an explanation
took place. She was afraid to touch it again, lest
her own inferior pencil should destroy some of its
beauties; though at the same time she remarked a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
few trifling defects, which she had not been conscious
of when painting at it the day before. But rather
than run the risk of spoiling the whole, she preferred
leaving these little imperfections as they were.
Sometimes she thought of showing it to her governess
and to her master; but the time of the examination
approached, and the temptation of keeping the secret
was very great.</p>

<p>However, she could not resolve to paint at the
picture that day herself. Before she went to bed,
she took the precaution of placing a chair against her
door, which had the bolt on the outside only, the
young ladies not being permitted to fasten themselves
up in their rooms.</p>

<p>She lay awake for a long time listening, but heard
not the slightest sound, and after a while she fell into
a profound sleep. When she awoke in the morning,
the door was still closed, and the chair standing just
as she had placed it; the picture was again on the
easel; some mysterious hand had again been engaged
on it, and all the faults had disappeared, or been
altered into beauties.</p>

<p>Josephine stood motionless with amazement. When
her bewildered thoughts settled themselves into a
distinct form, regret was her predominant feeling.
"What shall I do?" said she to herself. "I fear
this mystery if I allow it to go on, will end in something
very vexatious; and yet it may be only from
motives of kindness that some unknown person steals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
into my room at night, and works at my picture with
a skill far surpassing my own. Since I did not mention
it at first, were I now to relate this strange story,
I should lose my character for veracity, as no one,
I am sure, would believe me."</p>

<p>She painted no more at the picture, but put it away
as usual. That night she placed her washing-stand
against the door, laying her soap on the edge, so that
if moved, it would fall, and having gone to bed very
sleepy, she soon closed her eyes in her usual deep
slumber. In the morning, the washing-stand was still
against the door, the soap had not fallen, the picture
was once more on the easel, and&mdash;it was finished!</p>

<p>At the breakfast-table she stole inquiring glances at
the countenances of her school-mates, but none of
them looked particularly at <em>her</em>, and none of them
averted their eyes from her gaze. All seemed to
think only of the examination.</p>

<p>When she returned to her room, she drest herself
for the occasion, and wrapping her picture in her
pocket-handkerchief, she joined her companions, who
walked in procession to the principal school-room,
according to their rank in the class. All the instructors
were assembled. After being examined in several
other branches, the drawings and miniature paintings
were produced. When it came to the turn of
Josephine, she blushed as she presented her beautiful
picture.</p>

<p>Every one was astonished; it was so far superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
to any thing she had done before, particularly the
finishing. The young ladies from whom she had
sketched the figures, being present, every one was
struck with the fidelity of the likenesses, painted, as
they were, chiefly from memory; and great praise
was given, not only to the grace of the attitudes, but
to the easy and natural folds of the drapery, and the
clearness and beauty of the colouring. There was
also the novelty of two figures on the same ivory.</p>

<p>The superiority of this little picture was so manifest,
that there was no hesitation in awarding the
first prize, which was a small silver palette, to Josephine
Vericour. But to the surprise of every one,
Josephine showed no indication of joy at this signal
triumph. She looked round on all her companions,
seeking to discover the one who had painted the best
part of her picture for her in the night while she
slept. She fixed her eyes steadfastly on Julia, the
youngest daughter of Madame Dorival, who possessed
in a high degree the charming talent of miniature
painting.</p>

<p>Josephine, who had heard Julia commending her
picture, said to her, "Miss Julia, you may well admire
your own work. I have not merited the prize,
and I will not accept of praises which belong only
to you, to your skill in miniature painting, and to
the kindness of your heart."</p>

<p>Julia protested that this language was unintelligible
to her, and begged Josephine to explain herself. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
did so, and the enigma seemed still more incomprehensible.
Julia positively denied ever having seen
the picture before Josephine produced it at the examination.
In vain did Josephine detail all the circumstances
of its mysterious progress. Her statement
could not be reconciled to the rules of possibility,
and they began to think that her mind was affected
by intense application to her picture. The prize,
however, was decreed to her, in spite of her reluctance
to accept it; and when the examination was
over, the young ladies got together in groups, and
talked with much feeling of the symptoms of mental
derangement which had manifested themselves in the
unfortunate Josephine.</p>

<p>For a few weeks after the examination, Josephine
allowed her paint-box to remain with those of her
companions in one of the school-room closets, and
painted only under the direction of her master, and
during the time of her regular lessons; but though
there were marks of daily improvement, the miniatures
she now attempted were inferior to the mysterious
picture.</p>

<p>Being anxious to try again how she could succeed
in the solitude of her own apartment, she there commenced
a miniature of herself, which, if successful,
she intended as a present to her mother. By the assistance
of the large looking-glass that hung over the
table, she sketched the outline of her features with
great correctness, and after she had put in the dead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
colouring, (as the first tints are called,) she put away
her work for that day, and went to Julia, whom she
told of the new picture that she had just begun, and
of her anxiety to know whether her nocturnal visiter
would again assist her in completing it.</p>

<p>"Dear Miss Julia," said poor Josephine, "let me
entreat you to have compassion and tell me the whole
truth. If you have any private reasons for not wishing
it to be generally known, I solemnly promise to
disclose it to no one. Tell me how you always contrived
to enter my chamber in the night without disturbing
my sleep, and how you have been able to
paint so well by candlelight?"</p>

<p>"Miss Vericour," said Julia, "you surprise me
extremely by seeming to persist in the strange belief
that I am the unknown person who painted in
secret on your picture. This mystery must be solved;
and if you find it so difficult to believe my
word, you must assist me in discovering the truth.
Place nothing to-night against your door; do not
even latch it. Put away your painting apparatus as
usual, and go to bed, and to sleep if you can. I
have thought of a way of detecting the intruder, who,
I suppose, must of course be one of the young ladies.
When she is discovered, she shall be reprimanded,
and made to give up her part in this strange drama,
so that your perplexity will be at an end.</p>

<p>Josephine acquiesced with joy, and minutely followed
the directions of Julia. All the young ladies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
went to bed at nine o'clock, but on this night it was
long after ten before Josephine could compose herself
to sleep. When every one in the house had
gone to bed and all was quiet, Julia Dorival placed
a taper in a small dark lantern, and proceeded with
it to the passage into which Josephine's chamber
opened. There, seating herself on a chair outside
of the door, she remained patiently watching for
more than an hour. No one appeared; the clock
struck twelve, and Julia began to grow tired. She
was almost on the point of giving up the adventure,
when her ear was attracted by a slight noise in Josephine's
room.</p>

<p>Julia softly pushed open the door, and by the light
of her lantern, she saw Josephine dress herself in
her morning-gown, walk directly to her table, arrange
her painting materials, select her colours, seat
herself before the glass, and begin to paint at her
own miniature. But what was most astonishing,
she worked without any light, which Julia did not
at first remark, having her own lantern beside her
in the passage. She entered the chamber as softly
as possible, and placing herself behind Josephine's
chair, she looked at her as she painted, and was astonished
at the ease and skill with which she guided
her pencil, asleep and in darkness.</p>

<p>Julia Dorival was twenty years old, and with a
large fund of general information, she was not, of
course, ignorant of the extraordinary phenomenon of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
somnambulism, and of the most remarkable and
best authenticated anecdotes of sleep-walkers. But
among all that she had heard and read on the subject,
she recollected none more surprising than the
case now before her. She knew, also, that persons
under the influence of this singular habit should never
be suddenly awakened, as the shock and surprise
have been known to cause in them convulsions or delirium.
She therefore carefully avoided disturbing
Josephine, and gliding quietly out of the room, she
looked at her for some time from the passage, and
then gently closing the door, she left her to herself
and retired to her own apartment.</p>

<p>Next morning, Julia excited great surprise in her
mother and sister, by informing them of what she
had seen. They agreed to witness together that
night this interesting spectacle, and of course, not
to mention a word on the subject to Josephine, who,
when she innocently inquired of Julia the result of
her watching, was answered that she should know all
to-morrow.</p>

<p>They were much affected at the idea that this
young girl's earnest and praise-worthy desire to excel
in the art which was to be her future profession,
should have so wrought upon her mind, even in the
hours of repose, as almost to achieve a miracle, and
to enable her to prosecute employment with more
ardour, and even with more success, in darkness and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
in sleep, than in the light of day, and with all her
faculties awake.</p>

<p>At midnight, the three ladies repaired with their
lantern to the chamber door of Josephine. The
sleep-walker was putting on her gown. They saw
her seat herself at the table and begin to paint.
They approached close behind her without the smallest
noise, venturing to bring into the room their lantern;
of its dim light, Josephine was entirely unconscious.
They saw her mix her colours with great
judgment, and lay on the touches of her pencil with
the utmost delicacy and precision. Her eyes were
open, but she saw not with them; though she frequently
raised her head as if looking in the glass.</p>

<p>Somnambulists see nothing but the object on which
their attention is decidedly fixed; yet their perceptions
of this object are ascertained to be much clearer
and more vivid than when awake. If addressed,
they will generally answer coherently, and as if they
understood and heard; and it is possible to hold a
very rational dialogue with a sleep-walker. But
when awake, they have no recollection of any thing
that has passed during the time of somnambulism.</p>

<p>Julia ventured to speak to Josephine in a low
voice. "Well," said she, "my dear Josephine, you
know now who it is that paints in the night at your
pictures. You know that it is yourself. Do you
hear me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
"Does my presence disturb you?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Julia."</p>

<p>"But to-morrow, Josephine, you will not believe
what I shall tell you."</p>

<p>"Then it will be because I do not remember it."</p>

<p>"Will you write on this piece of paper something
that I wish to dictate to you?"</p>

<p>"Most willingly."</p>

<p>Josephine then took up a lead pencil, and wrote
these words as Julia prompted her:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Midnight.&mdash;Talking with Miss Julia Dorival, and
painting at a miniature of myself.</p>

<p class="left40"><span class="smcap">Josephine Vericour.</span>"</p>

<p>Julia took the paper, and prepared to retire, cautioning
the young artist not to fatigue herself by
painting too long.</p>

<p>"Do not fear," replied Josephine, "I always return
to bed as soon as I begin to feel weary."</p>

<p>The three ladies left the room on tip-toe, as they
had entered it, their minds wholly engrossed with
admiration at the phenomenon they had just witnessed.
Next morning, Julia had some trouble in convincing
Josephine of the fact, but the certificate
in her own writing was an undeniable evidence.
As there is something strange and awful, and frequently
dangerous, in the habit of somnambulism,
no one wishes to possess it; and Josephine was
anxious to get rid of it as soon as possible, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
though it enabled her to paint better than when
awake.</p>

<p>She would not trust her painting apparatus in her
chamber at night, and she dismissed all thought of
her miniature from her mind as soon as she went to
bed; and was consequently enabled to rest there till
morning as tranquilly as any of her school-mates, all
of whom were much amazed when they heard the
singular explanation of the Mysterious Picture.</p>

<p>This explanation once given, Madame Dorival
prohibited its becoming a subject of conversation.
Josephine made vigorous efforts to conquer her timidity
in presence of her master, and in a short time
she was able to paint as well under his inspection
as she had done when alone and asleep in the gloom
of midnight.</p>

<h2>THE PET LAMB.</h2>

<p class="title1">A TALE.</p>

<p class="center">BY MRS. HUGHS.</p>

<p>One cold bleak morning, in the latter end of March,
before winter had quite determined to resign
his tyrannical sway, though he had occasionally permitted
a few soft breezes to woo the opening buds of
the willow and the horse-chestnut, and scatter a few
of the earliest spring flowers over the fields, Farmer
Early happened, on his way to the place where his
labourers were at work, to pass a field in which he
had a number of sheep. Two or three times, as he
proceeded along, by the side of the fence, he thought
he heard a very feeble bleat, and stopped to see if
there was any youngling in need of more aid than
was in its mother's power to render. For some
time, however, he looked in vain, but at length the
sound became more distinct, and soon guided him to
a corner of the field, where he discovered a sheep
lying stretched out on its side, and a lamb, evidently
just born, lying near it. He hastened immediately to
the aid of the little complainer, and found that the
mother was stiff and cold, and that it was itself nearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
dead, for its feeble frame had been exposed to the
cold bleak wind and occasional falls of snow, without
having any tender mother to protect it from the
withering blast. He immediately took it in his arms
and returned home, though with but little hope that
any thing that could now be done for it would be of
any avail.</p>

</div></div>

<p>"Here, Sally! Sally!" cried he, as he entered
the door of his own house, and immediately his eldest
daughter came forward, on hearing the summons,
"I have brought you something to be kind to. Here
is a poor little lamb that has lost its mother, and you
must try to supply the place of one to it: I am afraid
it will be impossible to save it, but you must see what
you can do." Sally, whose heart overflowed with
tenderness toward every living thing, took the little
trembling creature in her arms, and summoning her
little sisters to partake of the pleasing task, and
indeed to share the fatigue which she was herself
but ill able to bear, she immediately began to prepare
a bed for it by the fire, and to warm some milk
for it.</p>

<p>"Do you think it will live, Sally?" said Peggy, as
she stood by her elder sister's side, "do you think
you can keep it from dying?"</p>

<p>"I hope so," answered Sally, holding the warm
milk to its mouth as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I won't let it die," said Kitty, with great earnestness.
"Will you, Sally?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
"Not if I can help it."</p>

<p>"And if it lives, won't you let me feed it sometimes?"
added Peggy, "and won't you let it be part
mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it shall be part yours, and you shall help
me to take care of it."</p>

<p>"And when it can walk, won't you let me take it
out and teach it to run about the green?"</p>

<p>"I rather think it will be more likely to teach you
to skip," returned her elder sister.</p>

<p>"I can run about already," said Kitty, and as she
spoke, she gave several bounds across the floor to
prove the truth of her assertion.</p>

<p>"What will you call it, Sally?" asked Peggy.</p>

<p>"I think we must call it Croppy, for you know
how the little lambs crop the short grass. How glad
I shall be if we can rear it. I never had a pet in my
life, and a pet lamb, of all things in the world, is
what I shall like the best."</p>

<p>"You always said I was your little pet," said
Kitty, looking up in her sister's face with an expression
of disappointment.</p>

<p>"And so you are," answered Sally, kissing her
affectionately; "but Croppy, if it live, will be a pet
to all of us."</p>

<p>"And it will live&mdash;I know it will," said Peggy.
"Only see how much better it looks, now that it is
warm, and has got some good milk."</p>

<p>The fact was, that little Croppy very soon began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
to show signs of the good effects of the kind treatment
it had received; and before the day was over,
it could stand, and in a few days more it began to
trot about, and was very soon able to commence the
business of giving the little girls lessons in running.
And here we shall leave him for a while, to give a
short account of the family in which he was now an
inmate.</p>

<p>Farmer Early's family consisted of Sally, whom
we have just introduced to our readers, and who was
fifteen years old, George, who was about one, and
Tom, who was rather more than two years younger
than she. Besides these, there were two little girls,
Peggy, who was seven, and Kitty, five years old.
They were all rather pretty and very pleasant looking
children; but Sally and George were the most
conspicuously interesting, both in appearance and
manners. George was of a more serious and thoughtful
cast than boys of his age generally are. He was
active, and always willing to do any thing in his
power to assist his father and those around him; but
these duties fulfilled, his chief delight was in reading,
and he would sit for hours together on the top of
a box in the garret, whither he was in the habit of
going for the sake of being out of the noise of the
other children, and would devour with the greatest
eagerness the contents of every book on which he
could lay his hands; and a strange mixture, it must
be confessed, it had been his fate to get hold of. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
had read "The Whole Duty of Man;" "Gulliver's
Travels;" "Cook's Voyages;" "Pilgrim's Progress;"
two or three odd volumes of some of the
Waverley novels, which he had bought for a few
cents a piece at an auction in the neighbouring town,
when sent there on an errand; but of all the treasures
of which he had ever become possessed, and
which seemed likely to have the most powerful influence
over his future character, was the Life of Franklin,
which he likewise purchased for a few cents at
an auction. Eagerly, nay, greedily, did he read this
interesting little volume. And when he rose from
the fascinating task, and recollected that he, who had
become one of the most distinguished philosophers
either of his own, or any other country, who had
been a negotiator with kings, and had done more,
perhaps, for his country than any other man, with
the exception of Washington alone, had once been a
poor, portionless, uneducated boy; and that all the
attainments, all the honours of which he afterwards
became possessed, were entirely the fruits of his
industry and economy, he drew himself up with a
noble feeling of pride and emulation, and said, "I
too, perhaps, may some time or other be a great
man; for every body has the power of being industrious,
economical, and good; and I never can be
much poorer than Franklin was when he first entered
Philadelphia with only a dollar in his pocket, and
when he went and bought a two-penny loaf and
made his dinner off it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
George had not derived his love of reading from
either his father or mother; for though respectable,
they were very ignorant people, and were much
more disposed to regret the disposition of their son
to spend his time, as they conceived, so unprofitably,
than to attempt to supply him with the means of indulging
his prevailing propensity. He was not, however,
without one affectionate and sympathizing
friend, who delighted in aiding him in every laudable
undertaking, and joined with interest in all his praise-worthy
pursuits. His sister Sally was, like himself,
gentle, affectionate, and thoughtful. She was not so
great a reader as George, for, indeed, the instruction
that she had received had been so very limited, and
she had always been kept so constantly employed in
assisting her mother in the household work, and in
taking care of the younger children, that she had
never learned to read with sufficient facility to make
the employment agreeable; but she delighted to listen
to George's accounts of the books he had read,
and was always ready to add her mite to the small
stock of money which he was able to save for the
purchase of more. Fondly, too, would she encourage
all his ardent aspirings after knowledge and virtue,
and all his sanguine anticipations of future eminence;
for to her he could breathe out his thoughts
almost before they were formed in his mind, conscious
as he did so, that they would meet no repulsive check,
no chilling reception, to nip the embryo blossom, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
prevent its ripening into fruit. There was yet another
circumstance which served to unite this affectionate
brother and sister in still closer bonds. Sally had
all her life been exceedingly delicate, and as she
advanced in age, that delicacy evidently rather increased
than diminished; and there was no one of
the whole family that showed so much consideration,
and so tender a sympathy for her weakness, as her
brother George; and the grateful girl never seemed
to think she could make a sufficient return for such
kindness.</p>

<p>We have spent so much time in dwelling on the
characters of the two elder branches of farmer
Early's family, that we can spare but little more for
the others; nor, indeed, is there much required; for
Tom was, like other boys, active, playful, and careless;
fond of guns, and dogs, and horses; priding
himself upon managing a horse better, and shooting
a partridge with truer aim than any boy in the neighbourhood;
and as to the little girls, they were like
most children of their age, sometimes troublesome,
but more generally good and engaging, and always
interesting to their parents and sister, who repeated
their sayings, and watched their sports with pride and
pleasure, and persuaded themselves that they were
the smartest and prettiest children that were ever seen.
Had the little Kitty, however, been at all less delighted
with their new inmate, Croppy, than she really
was, she might, perhaps, have been a little jealous of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
the attention which he gained from the whole family,
but more especially from Sally, who, as she said,
had never before had any living thing that she could
call her own; and as it soon learned to know her
voice, and would come bounding at her call from the
furthest point of the common before the door, or
would trot by her side to the dairy, anxiously looking
for his usual allowance, she almost wondered at herself
for the fondness which she felt for it. "It is
very silly of me, I know, to be so fond of this little
creature," she would sometimes say, as she mused
over her little pet; "for though he likes me better
than any body else at present, I know very well that
any other person who took the same care of him
would just do as well for him, and I should be forgotten
directly; but yet he seems as if he loved me,
and it is so delightful to be loved, that the attachment
of a little dumb animal makes me feel happy." As
Sally was thus musing, her hands were occupied with
tying together a number of wild flowers which the
children had just brought from the woods, and forming
them into a wreath.</p>

<p>"What is that for?" asked Kitty, who had sat
looking on so earnestly, that she had been insensible
to the many challenges which Croppy had given her
to a race over the common. "Who are you making
that for, Sally?"</p>

<p>"You shall see," answered her sister, and immediately
she called "Croppy! Croppy!" and in an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
instant, Croppy, though he had been almost out of
sight at the moment of her calling, was again at her
side. Sally hung the wreath round his neck, but was
obliged to tie it so tight that he could not reach it
with his mouth, or the display of Sally's taste would
soon have been in vain. "Now keep quiet, Croppy,
and do not spoil your garland before George comes
home from the field, because I have dressed you up
in honour of his birth-day. Now be quiet, good Croppy,"
continued she, as the little creature, less gratified
by being so ornamented, than worried by the unusual
incumbrance, tried, by rolling himself on the
grass, to disengage himself from it.</p>

<p>"Oh! here comes George," cried Peggy. "I'll
run and meet him, and bring him to see Croppy
before his birth-day dress is spoiled." But at the
same moment a voice was heard, calling in an
angry tone, "Sally! Sally! how can you think of
setting there on the damp grass, when you have
been so sick all day! I know well enough how it
will be&mdash;you will get cold, and will be laid up instead
of helping me to-morrow with the washing."
Poor Sally rose in an instant with a feeling of self-condemnation
at her own carelessness, but her heart
and eyes, at the same time, filling at the manner in
which her mother had upbraided her. As she returned
to the house, she met George hastening to admire
Croppy's finery; but he had heard his mother's
rebuke, and seeing the large tears standing in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
sister's eyes, Croppy was immediately forgotten, and
turning round with Sally, he devoted himself the rest
of the evening to cheering and amusing her. "It
only wants a few days now, Sally," said he, seeking,
in the subject the most interesting to himself, the
most probable means of amusing his sister, "it only
wants a few days now to the time of my going to
school. Father has promised me a month's schooling
before the harvest begins, and another when it is
over; and if I am diligent, I can learn a great deal
in that time. Oh, how I long to begin! I dream
about being at school every night; and I always
think that I am learning something that compels me
to study very hard, and I am always so glad, because
I think then I am learning the way to be a wise and
good man. Franklin had very little more schooling
than I shall have had by that time, and as to money,
he was as poor as I am, every bit; for when he first
came to Philadelphia, he had only a single dollar in
his pocket, and yet you see he got to be a very
great man."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sally, "but he had to study and
work very hard for a great many years first."</p>

<p>"To be sure he had," returned the brother with
animation; "but then so can I work, and so can I
study; I am not afraid of either. Did not I walk ten
miles yesterday, when I went that errand for the
squire, because he said he would give me a quarter
of a dollar? and here it is," he added, taking the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
money out of his pocket, and looking at it with great
complacency, "and I mean to get up by day break
in the morning, and go to buy a book with it that I
saw the other day, and that I want to read; I can get
it, I think, for a quarter of a dollar. And I'll tell
you another thing, Sally; I expect by the time I have
finished my month of schooling, you will be a great
deal stronger than you are now, and then I can teach
you every thing that I have learnt, and we shall be
so happy&mdash;shan't we, Sally?" Sally smiled assent,
but it was a languid smile, for the ardour of her
youthful mind was checked by the enfeebling influence
of disease.</p>

<p>The next morning Sally felt very forcibly the ill
effects of her imprudence in sitting on the damp
grass the night before; and though she still recollected
the severe manner in which her mother had
reproved her, she could not but be conscious that the
reproof was deserved. This made her very unwilling
to complain, though she rose with a severe pain
in her side, a burning fever in her veins, and a cough
which was always troublesome, but was now more
than usually distressing. Determined, however, not
to complain, and anxious, if possible, to conceal her
indisposition, she prepared to assist her mother in
every way in her power; and though she felt it
would be impossible for her to stand at the washing
tub, she washed and dressed her little sisters, prepared
the breakfast, and did a variety of offices equally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
useful, and was in hopes it would escape the observation
of every one, that what she did was performed
under the pressure of more pain and debility than
usual. She was assisted in this concealment by the
absence of George, who had not, at breakfast time,
returned from the town to which he had gone for the
purchase of the book of which he had spoken the
evening before; for had he been present, his watchful
eye, she well knew, would soon have discovered
the oppression under which she laboured. Breakfast,
however, was entirely over before he returned, and
when he did come, he only stayed to eat a piece of
dry bread and take a drink of water, a kind of fare
which would at any time have been sufficient to satisfy
him, but which he had now become extremely
fond of, since he found that Franklin ascribed so
much of his alacrity in business, and his facility in
study, to his adherence to that simple diet; and then
hastened to assist his father in the field. Sally sometimes
almost persuaded herself that her little pet
Croppy saw and understood that all was not right
with his young mistress; for instead of frisking about
the common as usual with the little girls, he kept
almost constantly trotting by her side, every now and
then rubbing his little head tenderly against her, and
appearing quite happy when she stooped down to pat
his head and speak to him in a tone of kindness.
Yet even this slight indulgence seemed almost more
than she had either time or spirits to bestow, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
continual repetition of Sally do this, and Sally do
that, kept her incessantly occupied till late in the
afternoon, when the chief of the business being over,
and she too much exhausted to support herself any
longer on her feet, had just sunk upon a seat, and was
patting the head which Croppy had come and laid on
her lap, when her father and brothers returned from
the field. "Sally," said the farmer, in a tone of
reproach, "you sit patting that lamb as if there was
nothing else to be done. Come, girl," he continued,
taking up a milking bucket as he spoke, "get your
bucket, and let us go and milk the cows." George,
who, at the moment his father spoke, had taken up
his newly purchased treasure, and had got half across
the room on the way to his private retreat, cast a
glance at his sister, and perceiving in an instant that
she was ill, he threw down his book, and saying, "Sit
still, Sally, for I am going to milk this evening," he
took the bucket and hastened after his father. Sally's
heart glowed with affection and gratitude. She had
always loved her brother, but never had he been half
so dear to her as at this moment. "Croppy, you
must love George for being so kind to your mistress,"
said she, addressing herself to the lamb for want of
a more sympathizing auditor, "you must love
George for my sake;" and she watched for his return,
impatient to let him know that she understood
and felt his kindness.</p>

<p>At length, the business of milking over, George
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
again appeared, but no longer with the glow of animation
on his countenance with which he had returned
from his day's labour, nor yet with the spirit and
alacrity with which he had left the house on his office
of kindness. "Is he sorry now, that he went?"
thought Sally, as she examined his countenance.
"Has he begun to think what a great deal he might
have read in the time that he has been milking?"
"Why don't you go to your book now, George?"
asked she, as she saw that, after disposing of the milk
bucket, her brother placed himself at the end of the
large table, on which he put up his arm, and rested
his head upon it with a look of great distress.
"Why don't you go and read now?" again she
inquired; "there is nothing to hinder you now."</p>

<p>"Because I don't want to," answered George, in
a tone very different from his usual cheerful, good
tempered voice.</p>

<p>"George, come here beside me," said Sally, tenderly,
for she began to feel alarmed at the expression
of her brother's countenance.</p>

<p>"Oh! I can't," returned the boy; "do let me
alone, I don't want to speak."</p>

<p>Sally's eyes filled with tears. "He is vexed at
me," thought she, "for he thinks I am always in
the way of his improving himself." George got up
and moved towards the stairs. "You are leaving
your book behind you, George," said Sally, glad to
think that he was going at last to his favourite employment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
"I don't want it," he replied; "I am
going to bed."</p>

<p>"George, do tell me what is the matter before you
go; are you sick?"</p>

<p>"No, I am not sick, but I don't want to talk; so
do let me alone." So saying, he went to bed, and
Sally soon after retired also, but not to sleep. Uneasiness
at the sudden and unaccountable change in her
brother's manner, added double violence to the disease
which was throbbing in her veins; and after a
restless and sleepless night, she attempted to rise in
the morning, but finding herself entirely unable to
do so, she was obliged to lay her head again upon
her pillow. "Aye, this is just what I thought would
be the case," said her mother, who coming up to
see why Sally had not made her appearance, found
her too ill to sit up; "I told you what you would
bring upon yourself by playing and idling your time
away with that little useless pet lamb of yours."
Mrs. Early did not mean to be an unkind mother,
but she, like many other people, had an unfortunate
manner of showing her affection, and generally vented
the uneasiness which the sight of her daughter's
indisposition occasioned, in a tone of reproach, for
which she had not always so much cause as on the
present occasion.</p>

<p>"I know I was wrong, mother, for sitting upon the
grass," said Sally, mildly, "but say no more about
it, for it cannot be helped; and ask George to come
up and see me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
"George has been out at work these two hours,"
replied her mother, "and here am I with all the
ironing to do, and every thing else to attend to, and
to nurse you into the bargain."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, mother, I don't need any nursing,"
returned the poor girl, who, though convinced her
mother did not mean any unkindness by this manner
of speaking, was yet unable to repress the tears
which filled her eyes and forced themselves down her
cheek as she spoke. "Only tell Peggy to bring me
up some water to drink, and I want nothing else."</p>

<p>"Aye, it's fine talking. But do you think I can
have you lying sick in bed, without coming to look
after you? And I'm sure I don't know how I'm to
find time to do it, and to do all the work besides.
But I will send Peggy up with a drink for you, and
will come up myself as often as I can," added the
mother, as she closed the door after her.</p>

<p>When left to herself, Sally's mind dwelt continually
on the thought of George's melancholy the night
before, which she was sure was still unremoved, or
he would never have thought of going to work without
first coming to inquire after her. Anxiety to
know the cause only increased the longer she dwelt
upon the subject. In vain did her little sisters try
their utmost efforts to amuse her, for which purpose,
even little Croppy was brought up stairs, and introduced
into the bed room; she looked at it with pleasure,
and gave the little girls strict injunctions to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
kind and attentive to it whilst she was unable to be
so herself; but again her mind recurred to the recollection
that something was amiss with her favourite
brother; and this idea, much more than the bodily
pain that she suffered, made every hour appear like
two, till he came home to his dinner. At length she
heard her father's voice below, and knowing that
George was in all probability there also, she knocked
down for her little attendant Peggy, and desired her
to ask George to come up and see her. He came
immediately, and the moment Sally saw him, she
perceived that the same expression of melancholy
remained on his countenance.</p>

<p>"George," said she, in a gentle, affectionate voice,
as he came toward her bed-side, "I wanted to see
you, to know if you have forgiven me."</p>

<p>"Forgiven, you, Sally! what had I to forgive?"
asked he, in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p>"For being the means of keeping you from going
up stairs to read last night."</p>

<p>"Oh! Sally, you surely do not think that I was
angry at you for being sick?"</p>

<p>"No, not angry at me for being sick, but angry
at me for having made myself sick by my own imprudence,
and so keeping you from the only enjoyment
you have."</p>

<p>"And don't you think, Sally, that I would rather
help you than read any book whatever?"</p>

<p>"I know you have always been very kind in helping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
me, but still what made you so sorrowful when
you came in from milking, if it was not that?"</p>

<p>"It was not that, at any rate," answered George.</p>

<p>"Then what was it? Do tell me, George, for I
know there is something amiss, and I cannot tell
what it is."</p>

<p>"It is nothing that you can help, Sally, so keep
yourself easy, and get well again, for that will sooner
bring back my spirits than any thing else."</p>

<p>"George, do tell me what is the matter. I am
very sick, and it only makes me worse to think of
your being so sorrowful, and I not know the cause."</p>

<p>"Oh! I am not sorrowful," returned George, endeavouring
to speak cheerfully, "I am only disappointed,
but I shall soon get over it; for my father
told me last night whilst we were milking, that he
has had so many losses this season, both in sheep,
and cows, and horses, that he will not be able to send
me to school as he had promised to do."</p>

<p>But though George began his speech with an
assumed cheerfulness, he was unable to keep it up;
and as he pronounced the last words, the tears, in
spite of his utmost efforts, filled his eyes, and were
about to force themselves down his cheeks, when the
voice of his mother calling him from below, checked
their course, and he hastened down stairs to obey the
summons.</p>

<p>"Tom, Sally wants you to go up stairs to her,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
said Peggy, in the evening, when the family were all
assembled to supper.</p>

<p>"Wants me!" said Tom, in surprise. "What
does she want me for? She surely does not expect
that I can read to her, or talk to her about books, as
George does."</p>

<p>"I don't know, but she said I must tell you to come
up and speak to her."</p>

<p>Tom went up stairs, but when he came down
again, though questioned by all around about the
business for which he had been sent, he refused to
gratify their curiosity; but after eating his supper in
silence, a very uncommon circumstance for him, for
he generally had some exploit to recount that he had
achieved with his gun, his horse, or his dog, he took
his hat and went out, without making any remark
about whither he was going, or what he was going
to do; nor on his return was he any more communicative,
though the curiosity of all was considerably
excited about the nature of the business he had been
upon.</p>

<p>In the mean time, Sally's illness increased in so
alarming a manner, that even her mother ceased to
talk about herself, and was anxious only for the health
of her child.</p>

<p>The poor girl, as if conscious that her sufferings
were only a just penance for the imprudence of which
she had been guilty, uttered no complaints, though
she tossed about the whole night in all the restlessness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
of a burning fever, and was, by the time that
day-light arrived, so ill, that George was despatched
in haste for the physician from the neighbouring
town, whose arrival was waited for with an impatience
that only those can understand who have
known what it is to watch by the side of a beloved
one, and count the minutes till the sufferer is relieved,
and strength is given to their sinking hopes.</p>

<p>"What can George be about?" said the mother,
looking out of the window, and straining her anxious
eyes in hopes of catching a glimpse of him as he
came across the common; "he never was so long on
an errand before. He surely might have managed
to come back himself before this time, whether the
doctor could come with him or not."</p>

<p>"Keep yourself easy, mother," said Sally, gently,
who was the only one that was not impatient, "I
am sure he will come back as soon as he possibly
can."</p>

<p>"Peggy, run along as far as the stable yonder,
and try if you can see any thing of him," added her
mother, "and come back directly and tell me if you
do."</p>

<p>Away went Peggy, followed by the little Kitty,
and having caught a sight of her elder brother, was
about to do as she had been ordered, and hasten to
the house to announce the intelligence, when her
curiosity was excited, and her steps arrested, by the
sight of another object, for whose presence she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
unable to account. "Why, who can that be that is
coming along the road with Tom? I declare it is
Ben, the butcher's boy. What can he want here, I
wonder?" At that moment Tom was heard calling
Croppy! Croppy! and in an instant Croppy came
bounding across the common to meet him. George,
too, had arrived at the same time from an opposite
direction, and eagerly inquired what he wanted with
Croppy; but the next moment, like a stroke of lightning,
the truth flashed across his mind, and, throwing
himself down by the side of the lamb, he clasped
his arms around its neck. "I know what is the matter&mdash;I
know it all," he exclaimed. "Sally is going to
sell Croppy, for the sake of paying for my schooling;
but its innocent life shall not be taken away for
any such thing. I can read and teach myself, and
Croppy shall not be killed."</p>

<p>"Hush, George, give over making that noise,
man. Don't you hear mother calling you? Get
up, I tell you, and don't make such a rout about a
lamb; it's not the first lamb that has been killed, I
am sure."</p>

<p>Peggy now caught the alarm, and bursting into
tears, she ran to the butcher's boy. "You must not
take Croppy away. Oh! you shall not kill our dear
little Croppy," she exclaimed, pushing the boy back
with her little hands as she spoke, while Kitty,
scarcely able to understand the meaning of what was
going forward, and anxious only to show kindness to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
their little favourite, had got some water from a
bucket that stood near her, and was trying to coax
the little creature to drink. But Croppy, as if conscious
of the fate that awaited him, was insensible
to all her solicitations. At this moment, the sound of
horses' feet was heard, and the next, the doctor rode
up to them, and struck with the expression of grief on
George's countenance, and with Peggy's distress,
inquired what was the matter. The story was soon
told. "Oh, cheer up, my good boy," said he, addressing
himself to George, whose sensibility and
anxiety for improvement struck him with equal admiration,
"keep yourself easy, for the lamb shall
live, and you shall go to school into the bargain."
So saying, he gave the butcher's boy a piece of
money to reconcile him to going back without the
lamb; then turning to George, he assured him that
he would take the expense of his schooling upon
himself, and that instead of a month, he should stay
a year, or more, if he found that he continued to set
as high a value as he at present did upon being furnished
with the means of improvement. "And now,"
added he, "I must go and see after this kind sister of
yours, whose health I shall be doubly anxious to
restore after this proof of her amiable and affectionate
disposition." But though he was on horseback,
George was at the house before him, and was making
his way immediately to Sally's room, when he
was stopped by his mother, who met him, and, in an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
agony of tears, told him that Sally was too ill to be
spoken to. Disappointed at not being able either to
express his gratitude for the proof of affection which
she had given, or to make her a sharer of his own
happiness, he sunk down on a seat, and waited the
return of the doctor, whom his mother now conducted
to the sick chamber. After waiting a long time,
he at length heard the sound of his footsteps on the
stairs, and his voice, as he spoke in a soft tone to his
mother. George fixed his eyes on the face of the
physician as he entered the room where he was, and
endeavoured to read in it what he thought of his patient,
but felt afraid to inquire.</p>

<p>"May I go up now?" asked he, in a timid voice.</p>

<p>"Yes. Go up, she is anxious to have you with
her, and I am sure I need not tell you to pay her all
the attention in your power."</p>

<p>George did not wait to make any reply, but was,
in an instant, by Sally's bed-side. But how great,
how alarming, was the change that he saw in her
from the time that he had last left her!</p>

<p>"Sally! dear Sally, I am come to thank you,"
said he. Sally raised her eyes and smiled on him
affectionately. "How kind it was to give up your
little pet to pay for my schooling. But, though I am
going to school, you will still have Croppy to be kind
to."</p>

<p>"Croppy will not be taken from me, but I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
soon be taken away from him. George, I am going
to leave you all very soon."</p>

<p>"Oh! Sally, don't talk that way," said George, in
a tone of extreme agitation. "What has the doctor
been doing to frighten you so?"</p>

<p>"The doctor has not frightened me. He told me
that he hoped he should make me well again, but I
know better; I know that I am dying; but I am not
frightened, for I know that I am going to a kind father.
I am sorry to part with you all, especially you, George,
but it must be, and we shall meet again soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk about dying, Sally," cried the
afflicted boy, the tears streaming down his cheeks as
he spoke, "don't talk about leaving us. I cannot
bear to think of parting with you."</p>

<p>"George," said Sally, and an almost heavenly expression
brightened her countenance as she spoke,
"you have read a great deal, but your reading will
be of little use if you have not learnt to know that it
is our duty to submit with patience to the will of our
Heavenly Father. I like to be with you, and am
sorry to think of leaving you, but I know we shall meet
again, and then there will be no more parting. But
we will talk no more about it now. Mother is coming,
and I don't want to distress her."</p>

<p>George looked at Sally, and tried to persuade
himself that she was mistaken in imagining herself
so ill. But the more he examined her countenance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
on which the indelible stamp of death was already
impressed, the more he was convinced that she was
right. From that moment, he scarcely quitted her
bed-side, but watched over her, read portions of the
scriptures to her whenever she was able to listen,
and even prayed with her. Her composure and benignity
were gradually communicated to his mind, so
that though the one of all the family who was the most
fondly attached to her, he was the only one who could
view her approaching death with sufficient calmness
to be able to listen to her when she talked about it.
Short was the time, however, that he was called upon
to exercise this self-command, for the vital torch was
nearly extinguished, and her short, but innocent life,
was nearly drawn to a close. George, whose affectionate
offices seemed to become more and more
grateful to her as the time approached nearer when
she must resign them altogether, had sat up with her
all night; and her mother, toward morning, was prevailed
upon to go and take a little rest, under the
assurance from Sally, that she did not need any thing
that her brother could not do for her. Just as her
mother left the room, the first beam of the morning
sun glanced through the window. "Put out the lamp,
George," said she, "and draw back the window curtain,
that I may see the sun rise. It is the last time that
I shall ever see it rise, and oh! it is a glorious sight.
I should have been glad, if I had been permitted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
live longer, for this world is beautiful, and I wanted to
see you a wise and good man, but that I hope you
will be, though I am not here to see it; and always
remember me, George, and think how dearly I loved
you. Raise me up a little, and put the pillows under
my shoulders&mdash;there, that will do. Oh! George, I
can't see! Take hold of my hand." George took
her hand, she pressed his gently; and he watched,
scarcely venturing to breathe, lest it should prevent
him from hearing her words when she should next
speak. But gradually he felt her hand relax from the
pressure of his; he looked at her lips, but they were
still; he put his face to her mouth, but no breath
escaped from it; all was motionless. He was conscious
that she was dead, but so sweet, so placid was
the repose into which she was sunk, that he was unwilling
to stir, lest he should destroy the heavenly
feeling. How long he thus hung over her, he was
himself unconscious; but when, at length, he was interrupted
by the entrance of some of the family, he
left the room, and hastened into the open air, as if
unwilling to mingle the hallowed feelings which pervaded
his mind with the more boisterous grief of the
other members of the family.</p>

<p>Violent grief, for such a death, George felt to be
impossible; and though he never ceased to think of
her loss but with the most affectionate regret, his
sorrow was so blended with the conviction that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
change was a happy one for her, that it soon softened
down to a holy and tender remembrance, which served
only to stimulate his mind to virtue and piety; and
the sweet proof that she had given so short a time
before her death of her affection for him, made him
cherish with grateful pleasure the recollection of
the Pet Lamb.</p>

<h2>LE LOUP ET L'AGNEAU.</h2>

<p class="center">BY THE AUTHOR OF LIGHTS OF EDUCATION.</p>

<p>Soon after the dreadful massacre of the white
inhabitants of St. Domingo many years ago, a
French family came to settle in Baltimore. With a
small sum of money, saved from the wreck of a large
fortune, they purchased an acre of ground, about a
mile from town, with a stone house built on it; over
which they contrived to spread a foreign appearance,
by thatching the slanting roof of the porch in front&mdash;latticing
the small windows&mdash;and hanging out a
nightingale in a wicker cage. The family consisted
of a gentleman and lady, a nephew, and an infant
daughter, with the domestics, the faithful adherents
of their master's adverse fortune. After some time,
Mr. Leroy obtained a small salary in the French
consul's office; Madame Leroy worked stays; the
servant woman (Pauline) made cakes, and sold them
at market, or in the park on <em>field-days</em>, to the followers
of the military assembled there. The man (Antoine)
cultivated West India vegetables; but when
Pauline was away, he added all the work of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
house to his own occupation; and could cook, wash,
and iron, better than herself, though he never scolded
half so loud. Little Susette was a sweet creature;
with bright laughing black eyes, and of a lively,
courageous temper. Her cousin was not so;
whether the horrid scenes he indistinctly remembered
in his own country, or the little sympathy he found
in another, tended the most to depression and fear, I
know not; but Louis was pensive even to sadness,
and timid almost to feminine weakness. These qualities,
so injurious to his future prospects, might have
been overcome, since they did not appear in the feelings
of his early childhood, had he been left either
with his family, in the peaceful enjoyment of his own
little pleasures, or found associates, who would have
enlivened and encouraged by kindness and protection.
But the only boy who sought his society, was
the least likely to benefit him in this respect. He
was the son of a wealthy brewer, whose residence
was near Mr. Leroy's, and his name was Michael
Redman; commonly called Mike, and sometimes
Red Mike. This boy was the usual companion of
Louis, from beyond the Falls to school, and back
again. Strange, that nothing should grow out of
such constant intercourse, in a free country, but wanton
oppression and slavish fear; because the ready
invention and quick perception of the little Frenchman
excited the envy of his unintellectual companion,
though he affected to despise all the delicate endowments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
of that mind, which he kept in bondage
by the exercise of his savage strength alone; but
this reduced Louis to the most degraded state of slavery,
till at length he became subservient to his
tyrant's purposes on every occasion; would I could
say of good <em>or</em> evil, where all was evil. On Michael's
youthful countenance already were impressed
the marks of fatal passions; and every day the
traces deepened, the shadows darkened. This was
more perceptible, whenever his forbidding face appeared
in opposition to the lovely, innocent countenance
of Louis Leroy; and then so remarkable was
the contrast exhibited, that any one would have been
struck with the truth of the application, when an old
French gentleman, who usually came on an evening
to share Mr. Leroy's frugal supper, of bread and
salad, exclaimed on seeing the two boys together&mdash;"Voila,
le loup et l'agneau." (Behold, the wolf and
the lamb.) Well might he say so, and the transactions
of two days will prove it sufficiently to the
reader. Little Susette had been ill, and was ordered
regular exposure in the open air. This was not so
easy, considering the constant occupation of the family;
but Louis carried her in his arms all about the
place, whenever he was at home, till she recovered,
and then she soon grew too stout for his nursing; so
one day, when Pauline was gone to attend a parade
in the park, Antoine was spreading out beans and
okras at the back of the house to dry, and Madame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Leroy was finishing a pair of stays, Louis took the
baby in his arms, and carried her under a shady tree;
when sitting down beside her, he began to contrive
in his thoughts a proper coach for her.</p>

<p class="center">THE WOLF &amp; THE LAMB.</p>
</div></div>

<p>As soon as he had drawn out the plan in his head,
he set about the execution of it with his hands; and
by the labour of a few Saturdays, and the sacrifice of
a little money that his teacher had given him for some
service in the school, he made her an elegant carriage,
which he painted with yellow ochre, and emblazoned
with his uncle's coat of arms, as he thought he remembered
it on the old family coach, belonging to
three generations of noblesse in St. Domingo. He
had put the infant in her fairy vehicle, and was
drawing her toward the house, to show it to his aunt,
when Mike Redman appeared. "Hurra, Louy, what
have you got there? It looks like a frog in a pumpkin
shell." The comparison was not unapt, when he
only saw a small head, and two little fat hands, peeping
out of a yellow box. "Come, tumble it out here,
I want you to go a-fishing, and this wagon will do to
carry them home in." "Oh, no, Michael, that is little
Susette's." "Oh, never mind, she's able to trot about
well enough on her own stumpy legs; but the fish
have no feet to walk." "I will bring Antoine's basket."
"No, you needn't, this thing here is a great
deal better; and we'll keep it for that always. So
hurra, Miss Susan, clear out, and run as fast as you
can." Saying this, he took the baby from the carriage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
and stood her on the ground; upon which she
did not cry, but remained looking in his face, with a
mixed expression of surprise and dislike, and never
offered to stir; Louis, who at the moment was more
afraid for Susette than himself, agreed to go with
Mike, if he would wait till he carried the child in.
Satisfied with his conquest so far, Redman remained;
and when Louis returned, they set off,&mdash;but this poor
boy could not recover the mortification of sacrificing
the toy he had made, with such ingenuity, for the
use of his little cousin, and with which he thought
he should delight her parents, for the portage of Mike
Redman's fish: yet, even this was not so painful a
sensation, as he felt, when forced by his companion
to catch worms, and bait the hooks with them. At the
commencement, indeed, he was so much overcome,
that he sickened to faintishness, upon which Michael
showed so much feeling, as to throw a hat-full of
water in his face; from which it descended in streams
to his breast, and making his clothes thoroughly wet,
promised to add ill-health to the other evils of his constitution.
When the boys were returning home,
Mike said, "This is a prime thing, Louy&mdash;this here
wagon, I'm going to keep it, to carry things always;
you can easily get another for yourself, if you want."
"No, Michael, I cannot, I have not more money."
"Oh! well then, you can do without&mdash;as you did
before you made it." "But, little Susette, she cannot
do without it, because she is sick." "Sick&mdash;not she,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
I tell you&mdash;she's as stout as any little pig, so you
must make her walk." "Oh, no, Michael, she is
too little, she cannot walk such a great deal." "To
be sure she can&mdash;it is the very thing for her; why,
she'll grow as round as one of them tubs yonder in
our yard, if you let her ride; so, I'll keep the carriage
for that; and, look here, Louy, since you're so
clever at these sort o' notions, I want you to make
me some arrows. You must get me a dozen done
by Saturday&mdash;that's the last of our holidays, you
know&mdash;and then, if I shoot any birds a <em>Sunday</em>, I'll
give you one or two for your supper." "I do not
want them, Michael, I would prefer you let them sing
on Sunday."&mdash;"Well, I don't want to give you any
birds, if you prefer <em>go without</em>&mdash;but you must make
me the arrows at any rate, and if you don't have
them ready, when I call for them, you'll be sorry."
What Mike Redman wanted with a dozen arrows
and a baby's carriage, I leave to the consideration of
those young people, who have witnessed in their
companions a premature acuteness in ways of traffic;
which discovers itself in the sale, or barter, of all
the small wares they can beg or borrow: I omit the
other word, so commonly united with these two, because,
I trust, that at this period, when education has
extended moral influence so far, there is not one,
in the whole circle of boyish transgressions, to whom
the application of such a word would not be a false
and shocking libel. The characters of children then,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
perhaps, were less attended to; and certainly Mike
Redman's parents, though they fed him plentifully,
and clothed him fashionably, could never have instructed
him in the slightest principle; since he did
not give without reluctance, to the poor boy who
assisted him materially, a few little fishes to help out
his miserable dinner, or scruple to take from him a
toy that had cost him three days' labour, and the
money that otherwise should have purchased him a
new jacket, (which he sadly wanted,) to procure
pleasure for his infant relative.</p>

<p>When Louis entered the room, where the family
usually assembled, he found the old French gentleman
had come to dine with them; though there was
nothing on the table, but a dish of okra or gumbo
soup, a salad, and an omelette; to which, however,
were soon added, through the quick hands of Antoine,
Louis's contribution of fish; and surely round
any richer board, there was not then assembled a
more striking picture of "the sublime and beautiful:"
a Christian philosopher cheerfully resigned to
the changes of fortune, and his lovely companion,
with faithful affection, smiling while she shared his
fate. There was so striking a resemblance between
Madame Leroy and her nephew, that many persons
supposed they were mother and son; and as he was
the only child of a beloved sister, that escaped the
general death, she loved him as if he had been her
own. Mr. Leroy was also related to him in the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
degree; his brother having married the mother of
Louis,&mdash;had this not been the case, however, he
would have been fond of him for his wife's sake.
He loved every one that she loved, and herself more
than all. Little Susette had forgotten her coach, or
resigned to its loss, was making smiling faces over
her soup as she drafted it from her plate to her
mouth, by half spoonfuls at a time. Poor Louis
almost forgot his hardships, under a cruel task-master,
when he sat down to his temperate meal, with
so good an appetite; while the pleasant jests of the
gay old gentleman were relished by all the party,
with that better philosophy of the French school,
which teaches to make the most of the simplest
pleasures, and which, I am afraid, few but her own
scholars have learned. The next morning Louis
arose early, to perform his allotted task, which would
have been easy enough, even had he been less expert.
His aunt, whom he did not inform that this
labour was involuntary, and from whom he had constantly
concealed all the other impositions of Mike
Redman, gave him a dozen large pins to tip the
arrows with, and Antoine cut him the most suitable
wood. But light as the task was, his spirit now
rebelled at this slavery, and whispered "Be free," so
with a revolting soul he finished the arrows. But
Michael, whose father had taken him to the country
on Saturday, could not call for them before Monday,
when they were to go to school. Louis had a satchel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
made, ready to carry his books neatly; but Mike,
whose mother never thought of making him one, was
obliged to carry his as well as he could without, and
he now threw them down with his cap and gloves,
to examine the arrows; little Susette, who was playing
in the yard, with a tin cup, and with which she
had been making music on the stones, now began to
look at the books, and with the usual destructiveness
of infancy to the works of literature, she tore some
of the leaves out. When Mike had put all the arrows
in the quiver, except one, he turned round, and seeing
the condition of his books, he flew at the little
creature in a rage, as if he would tear her in pieces;
and so verify his title to the name of a wolf. The
cowardice of Louis at that instant vanished; he
sprang forward, and seized the young savage by the
collar, while his faithful little dog caught hold of one
of the straps of Mike's trowsers. This gave the
infant some time to escape, and with terrifying cries
she ran toward the house. Her mother came to the
door in dreadful alarm, when seeing her nephew
closed up against the garden gate, by the powerful
shoulders of Mike Redman, (who had his hands
clenched,) and the little dog howling at his feet, in
extreme pain, she called, in the agony of fear, upon
two men, who were looking out from the brewery
yard, at the boys' affray, to separate them. "Be
aisy, Casper," said one, "and let the boys fight it
out, I'll jist step over and see the Frenchman clear o'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
the fence." "Put I'll see de Frenchman clear o'
Mike, Patrick; mine hearts, de poy wouldn't stant
no chance at all mit him." With these separate intentions,
they both sallied forth, and approached the
combatants. Pat released the Frenchman, but Mike,
resisting the interference of such authority, was
knocked down by the German; who, as an excuse
for himself, when he was called upon by Mr. Redman
to relate the whole transaction, offered this:&mdash;"In
my country, de poys are prought up to mind the
sayins o' pigger people." Mr. Redman, who was
not himself an unjust man, admitted the apology,
and soon after, considering, perhaps, though it was
then too late, that he did not properly control his
vicious propensities, while he exposed them to continual
increase in the contaminating sphere around
him, he sent Michael to school at a distance from
home, and recompensed his little neighbour, by many
acts of kindness, for the cruel oppression of his son.
When I asked the person, who told me this story,
what became of the two boys in after life, he said,
Michael Redman inherited a large property, which
he soon spent; after this he went to sea; and I would,
probably, never have learned his final fate, had he
not been announced in the newspapers, some years
after, with an <i>alias</i> to his name, among a number of
men who were executed for piracy. In process of
time, Louis Leroy married his young cousin Susette;
and proved, through a long course of years, his filial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
affection to her parents. He contrived to add to his
small patrimony by several useful inventions, which
were patented in the state. He reared up a numerous
family, with the same frugal and temperate
habits that he had been taught, and under the same
roof which had sheltered his own boyhood; while
all the other habitations that had risen around him
were constantly changing their owners and inmates.
Behold the just end of "Le Loup et L'Agneau."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<h2>THE CHRISTMAS VISIT.</h2>

<p>"Come hither, Emily," said Mrs. Osman to her
daughter, a little girl about six years old, who had
just returned from school; "Come hither, for I have
something to tell you."</p>

<p>"What is it, mamma? Have you had a letter
from papa? and is he coming home soon?"</p>

<p>"No, that is not it, though I hope your papa will
now very soon be home again; but it is that your
friend, Mrs. Cassy, has just been here, to invite you
to spend the day with her on Christmas day, to meet
your friend Julia."</p>

<p>"Oh! delightful, how very kind Mrs. Cassy is!"
said the little girl with great animation.</p>

<p>"She is, indeed! And though the object of this
invitation is to give Julia a treat before she leaves the
country, which you know she will now soon do, as
her mamma has sent for her, to return home with
her uncle who is to set off in a few days: yet it will,
I am sure, be quite as great a pleasure to yourself;
for though Mrs. Cassy has no children of her own,
you know how much pains she always takes to make
her house pleasant to her little visiters."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
"Oh, yes! I remember the last time we were
there, she had a large baby for us, that she had dressed
herself. And it had a beautiful frock and cap, and
a pair of socks, just like those that my little sister
Emma wears; and we played at its being sick; and
then Mrs. Cassy made a scramble of raisins and sugarplums,
and a great many other good things, and we
had such fun in picking them up! Oh! it was delightful.
I hope you will let me go, mamma!"</p>

<p>"Yes! upon one condition."</p>

<p>"Oh! I know what that condition will be. It will
be about my tickets for good conduct."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are quite right. You know, Emily,
your great fault is idling. You are apt to spend your
time idling when you ought to be attending to your
lessons. But if you get&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A ticket every day for good conduct," interrupted
the little girl.</p>

<p>"Yes! I am sure you will not receive a ticket for
good conduct unless your lessons have been properly
attended to, and your behaviour in school has been
such as it ought to be; and therefore your going to
Mrs. Cassy's must depend upon your tickets for good
conduct. It only wants two days to Christmas day,
and if you can bring me a ticket each day for good
conduct you shall go: but if not, you must be content
to stay at home. It is a very short time for you
to keep watch over yourself, so that if you fail, I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
sure even your friend Mrs. Cassy herself will not
think that you deserve to partake of her kindness."</p>

<p>"Oh! if it only depends upon my getting two
tickets for good conduct, I am sure I shall go," returned
the little Emily, clapping her hands with
pleasure. "Let me see! This is Monday evening;
there is only Tuesday and Wednesday; and on
Wednesday we shall have school only half the day;
so that I shall have to watch myself only a very
short time."</p>

<p>"True, Emily, it will only be a very short time,
and therefore the terms on which your going depends
are not, you see, very severe; but yet that time, short
as it is, may be of great service to you, as every
time you try, you do something toward forming a
habit of attention; and besides, if you succeed, you
will both please me, and prove to your friend Mrs.
Cassy that you know how to value her kindness."</p>

<p>"I will go directly and learn my lessons for to-morrow,"
said Emily, and taking up her bag of
books she hastened into a little back parlour, in which
she was in the habit of studying her lessons. For
some time she kept her attention very steadily fixed
on her work; but just as she had taken her geography
and opened her map to trace the boundaries of
North America, a lady who frequently visited her
mother, and who sung very well, began at that moment
in an adjoining room to sing a song of which
Emily was very fond. The little girl had a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
good ear for music, and was so exceedingly fond of
it, that it was with great difficulty that she could keep
her attention fixed upon what she was doing. Over
and over again she was on the point of leaving her
lessons, and going into the parlour where the musician
was; but she recollected how soon it would be
bed-time, and how little time there was whilst the
mornings were so very short, to learn any lessons that
had been neglected the evening before, and determined
to persevere; and clasping her little hands, and
laying them on the book before her, as if to hold
fast her resolution, she repeated, North America is
bounded on the north by the Arctic ocean, on the
west and south by the Pacific ocean, and on the east
by the Atlantic ocean. It is true that as she repeated
this, and found answers to the rest of the questions
which were contained in her lesson, her feet beat
time against the chair, and her head moved in
unison, whilst she sometimes found herself trying to
make the words of her lesson accord with the measure
of the music, as she spun out the words eighty-five
degrees of north la-ti-tude, yet still she contrived
to keep her mind fixed upon what she was doing till
she had impressed it on her memory, so as to be
sure of being able to call it forward, when required,
the following day. "Now I know all my lessons
perfectly," said she, as she replaced her books in her
bag: "I am sure of not losing my ticket to-morrow
on account of my lessons." So saying, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
hastened into the other parlour, but the music was
over, the lady was gone, and the room was empty.
Emily, however, was seldom at a loss for means of
amusement, and she skipped about the room, singing
"I'll be a butterfly," as if she were indeed that
light and airy creature of pleasure. Satisfied with
herself for the resolution that she had exercised, the
rest of the evening was spent in more than even her
usual cheerfulness, and she laid her head down upon
the pillow with repeated resolutions of attention the
following day. When the little girl opened her eyes
the next morning, it looked so gloomy and dark that
she very willingly persuaded herself it was too soon
to rise, and had just turned over to compose herself
for another nap when the clock struck eight. In an
instant she was out of bed. She had only a single
hour in which to dress herself, to eat her breakfast,
and go to school; she had not, therefore, a single
moment to lose. Yet a strong temptation assailed
her, for on a chair by her bed-side lay a small paper
parcel, directed to her, which on opening she found
to contain a cap, that her friend Julia had made for
her baby, and which had been sent to her after she
was in bed the night before, and placed by the servant
near her bed-side, that she might see it as soon
as she rose in the morning. "Oh! what a beautiful
little cap," exclaimed Emily. "How sweet my baby
will look in it. I must try it on directly. But no,"
added she, recollecting herself, "I must not stay to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
try it on now or I shall be too late for school, and
then away goes my ticket for good conduct at once."
And with an effort of self denial that would have
done credit to a much older mind, Emily put the
tempting cap into a drawer and hastened to finish her
dressing. Her breakfast was soon swallowed, and
she was in the school-room before the school bell
rang. "I think now I am safe for to-day," said she,
"only I hope Julia will not be in one of her funny
humours and try to make me laugh." To the credit
of our little heroine, however, though Julia was in a
funny humour and did frequently try to make her
laugh, and though Emily's gay and even volatile
temper was ever ready to receive a lively impression,
yet still she succeeded in keeping herself so far
within bounds as to escape reproof, and she returned
home in the evening with the wished-for ticket.
"Here it is, mamma! here it is!" cried she, running
to her mother, and holding out the testimony of her
good behaviour. Her mother took the ticket, and
congratulated her upon having got over half the time
successfully. "More than half, mamma," returned
Emma, "for to-morrow will be only half a day, and
I have very few lessons to learn to-night."</p>

<p>"I am not sure that you are any more safe on that
account, Emma," replied her mother, "for you know
I have often remarked to you, that you generally prepare
your lessons the worst when you consider them
the easiest; as then you are apt, from the idea that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
they can be learnt in so very short a time, to put
them off until you have no time for them at all, instead
of learning them first and amusing yourself afterward."
"But I will not do so to-night," said the
little girl, and away she went directly to study them.
And fortunate it was for her that she did so, for she
had scarcely finished the last thing that she had to
learn before her friend Julia came to play with her.
She could now, however, play with safety, and the
rest of the evening was passed in amusement. The
new cap was tried on and found to fit beautifully, and
the baby was dressed and undressed, put to bed and
taken up again; declared to be very sick and obliged
to take medicine; taken out to visit; sent to bed for
being naughty; and, in short, passed through all the
vicissitudes of a moderate life-time before the friends
parted for the night.</p>

<p>"It is eight o'clock," cried Emily, capering about
the room, half dancing and half jumping as she
spoke; "I am safe for to-day, and I have only till
twelve o'clock to-morrow, and then I shall get my
ticket, and then I shall be safe; and then I shall go
to Mrs. Cassy's."</p>

<p>"And then," rejoined her mother, "I hope you will
have learned how much better it is to work first and
play after, than to play first and run the risk of the
work being neglected altogether."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, mamma! I intend to remember that
in future," said the little girl, and away she went to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
bed, singing as she went, to a tune of her own
making,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"How pleasant it is at the end of the day,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Of no follies to have to repent."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Emily!" said her mother, rousing her little girl
from a sound sleep, as she spoke; "Emily! Do you
know it is nearly eight o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Oh! it is time enough, mamma," said Emily,
starting up as she spoke; "it struck eight o'clock
before I was out of bed yesterday morning; and yet
I was in the school-room some minutes before the
bell rang."</p>

<p>"But if you trifle in that way, it will be nine o'clock
before you are out of this room," continued her
mother; as Emily, taking hold of her little night-gown,
instead of a frock, began to practice her dancing
steps. "You see, my dear, you have yet only got
your stockings and shoes on; so, at this rate, it will
certainly take you more than an hour to finish your
dressing."</p>

<p>"Oh! indeed you are mistaken, mamma, you will
see how soon I shall be out of the room," and roused
to recollection by this remonstrance, the rest of her
dressing was very quickly finished. Her breakfast
too was despatched with equal rapidity. "Now I
am ready," said she, starting from her chair, and
putting on her little brown beaver hat as she spoke;
"and now for my coat; but stop," she continued,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
throwing her coat carelessly over her arm; "I have
not my bag: Where is it, I wonder? Oh! I remember!
I left it in the piazza when I went to look what
sort of a morning it was;" and off she went, dragging
her coat, which still hung over her arm, after her;
and on the piazza she found her bag, mittens, one of
her books, and slate, all lying as she had thrown
them out of her hand, to run after some trifle that
had at the moment attracted her attention; but as she
took up her bag with the intention of putting her
book and slate into it, her favourite kitten, which had
followed her to the piazza, running after her coat as it
dragged after her along the floor, now caught at the
bag, and tugged and scratched at it, as if it had
been intended entirely for its amusement. This was
too congenial with Emily's own frolicsome disposition
to be resisted, and there she stood, at one moment
drawing the bag away, and the next throwing
it back again to the sportive little animal. And we
must be permitted here to pause and describe our
little friend, as she looked while thus engaged. It
was one of those fine mild mornings, which of late
years we have so often witnessed in the very depth
of winter, and the sun, which had just risen, sent
forth his beams to gild the landscape behind her, defining
her figure more clearly by the contrast. To
the eye of fancy and affection, that rising sun might
have been thought to represent her whose orb like
his own was just rising; and though a few mists yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
obscured the bright rays of mind which had already
begun to beam, yet no one could look at the face,
which, though not formed according to any of the
acknowledged rules of beauty, was bright with innocence,
animation, and happiness, without feeling
assured, that as it gained its meridian heights, it
would shine forth with pure, unclouded lustre, and
prepare the way for a clear and glorious evening.
Though Emily, as she thus stood, presented a picture
that a painter might study, it was but of short
duration, for whilst she yet played with her favourite,
the clock struck nine, and at once recalled the little
girl to a recollection of her folly. "Oh! what shall
I do?" she exclaimed. "It is nine o'clock, and I am
not ready. Get away, kitty! do not come near me
again," she continued, as the kitten, which had
received no warning from the stroke of the clock,
still tried to catch at the strings of the bag whilst she
was putting in its usual contents; "get away! for if
you had not come near me, I should not have staid
so long. I should not have been tempted with any
thing else. Oh! how hard my coat is to get on this
morning. I cannot tell what is the matter with this
hook and eye! it will not fasten. Yes! now it is
fastened and I must run." But though poor Emily
did run, and put herself into a most violent heat;
and though she went into the school-room puffing
and blowing, the words, as she entered, of "Miss
Emily Osman&mdash;you are too late," told her at once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
that all chance of visiting her friend Mrs. Cassy was
over.</p>

<p>A few tears chased each other silently down her
cheek, as she took her seat at her desk, and for the
rest of the day it was little effort to poor Emily to
be silent and attentive. Julia tried a thousand ways
to excite a smile, but in vain; for the idea that she
had not only deprived herself of so much pleasure
for the morrow, but had disappointed her mamma
and appeared ungrateful to Mrs. Cassy for her kindness,
weighed on her mind, and every now and then
filled her eyes with tears. "Do not cry, Emily, I
beg of you," said Julia, as they returned home together,
after the school hours were over, "I am quite
sure your mamma will let you go to Mrs. Cassy's,
after all. I feel quite certain of it, for you know
this is almost the last day we have to be together;
and I am sure she could not find in her heart to deprive
you of the pleasure for such a trifle."</p>

<p>"No! my mamma never changes her mind after
she has promised me any thing," said Emily, "and
I am glad she does not, because it always makes me
sure that if I am good I shall get the reward I expect."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, but she may change her mind just
about such a little trifle as that, after all," returned
Julia.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure she will not," was Emily's quiet
reply, and the friends parted, as their roads now lay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
in different directions. As Emily entered the house,
she felt almost ashamed of meeting her mamma,
and she blushed at the idea of the reluctance which
she felt; but she soon found that, for the present at
least, she was saved the pain of seeing her, for she
was told that a very short time after she went to
school, her mother had been sent for to a very particular
friend, who was dangerously ill, and that she
was not yet returned. Emily always thought the
house very forlorn and dull when her mother was
not in it, but now that she was out of spirits herself,
she felt it more so than ever, and she hung about
listless and uneasy, and unable to enter into any of
her usual amusements. She tried to sing, but her
voice was husky and out of tune. She began to
practise her steps, but it was impossible to dance
without music, and Emily that day had no music in
her soul. She took out her baby, with the intention
of amusing herself with it, but it brought to her recollection
the pleasure she had expected to enjoy in
playing with Mrs. Cassy's baby the next day; and
she put it aside, and forgot that she had expected entertainment
from it. Even her little kitten, which,
from its fondness for play, seemed to be so nearly
allied to herself, played with a ball of cotton, or ran
after its own tail, round and round the room, in vain;
for Emily only recollected that it was it that had
tempted her to the neglect of her duty in the morning.
"I wonder when my mamma will come home," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
she to herself, as the short winter's day began to
draw to a close. "I wish she would come that I
might see her, and hear her say that she forgives me,
and will not punish me any further than by not letting
me go to Mrs. Cassy's. I hope she will not look
grave at me, for that will be worse than all. I wish
she would come that I might know at once what she
would say. Oh! perhaps that is she," added the
little girl, starting up and running to the window at
the sound of the door bell; but it was too dark for
her to see who it was, and she was returning to the
fireside, when the room door opened and the servant
brought in a letter, which he said was for her. "For
me!" cried Emily, in great surprise; "who can
have written to me? I never received a letter in my
life from any body." A lamp, however, was lighted,
and the letter opened, which proved to be from Julia,
and, after spelling and puzzling over it for a considerable
time, Emily at length made out the following
epistle:</p>

<p class="blockquote">"My dear Emily,<br />
"I have just heard that your mamma is not at
home; and I wanted to come round to you, but my
aunt would not let me. But I have sent you the ticket
for good conduct, which I got to-day, and you
may call it your own. It will not be cheating, you
know, because you did behave very well at school,
and then we shall meet at Mrs. Cassy's to-morrow,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
which will be delightful; for you know it is almost
the last day that we can be together, before I go
away.<br />
<span class="left20">"Your affectionate friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap left40">"Julia."</span></p>

<p>Julia, who was nearly two years older than Emily,
had written this letter with much more ease than her
friend could read it. She, at last, however, succeeded
in deciphering it; and, after having made herself
fully acquainted with its contents, she took the ticket
which was enclosed in it, and putting it very carefully
by, as deliberately put the letter into the fire.
From that moment Emily's face began gradually to
brighten, her voice became less husky, and though
she did not jump and skip about as she was in the
habit of doing, yet she ceased to stretch and yawn,
and wish the evening was over; and her countenance,
though more thoughtful than usual, was expressive
only of composure and satisfaction. The return of
her mamma, which she had sometimes wished for
and sometimes dreaded, now appeared to have become
of less importance to her, so that on finding,
by her usual bed-time, that she was not yet come
home, she went very contentedly to bed, and was
soon wrapped in a sound sleep. Her first object, on
waking in the morning, was to ascertain whether
her mother was yet returned, but finding that she
was not, she prepared to spend some more hours
alone. Emily, however, though a very little girl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
was able not only to read, but to understand what
she read; so that she could easily find amusement
from the variety of little books with which her mamma
had supplied her; and this made the morning pass
over very comfortably, till about twelve o'clock, when
she began to feel very anxious for her mother's return.
It seemed a long time since she had seen her;
she did not remember, ever in her life having been
so long absent from her before, and she sighed and
wondered when she would come. At length she
heard some one open the front door, and come along
the entry; and her little heart began to beat at the
idea of meeting her mother. The door opened, but
instead of her mamma, Julia entered, very prettily
dressed, and evidently prepared for her visit.</p>

<p>"Why, Emily!" she exclaimed, as she came forward,
"not dressed yet! I expected to find you
ready to go."</p>

<p>"Go where?" asked the little girl.</p>

<p>"Why, to Mrs. Cassy's to be sure. Where else
could I mean?"</p>

<p>"You know I am not going to Mrs. Cassy's."</p>

<p>"Why not? has your mamma found out that the
ticket was mine?"</p>

<p>"I have not seen my mamma since yesterday
morning. She has never been at home yet."</p>

<p>"Then why are you not going? You have no
need to wait for her to give you leave to go, when
you know she said you should go if you could bring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
her a ticket for good conduct, each day; and you
can show her one when she comes home."</p>

<p>"Yes! but not one of my own."</p>

<p>"Yes! it is your own, for I have given it to you."</p>

<p>"But it is not gained by my own good behaviour."</p>

<p>"But you deserved to have one, for you never
behaved better in school, in your life, than you did
yesterday morning. You only lost your ticket for
being a very few minutes too late, and therefore, it
will not be cheating at all, to tell your mamma that
you behaved well." Happily, however, for Emily,
there had been so much pains taken to impress upon
her mind, from her earliest dawn of thought, a nice
distinction between truth and falsehood, that she was
not to be deceived by this false reasoning of her
friend, whose mind having been less carefully guarded,
had adopted the error, so common with young
people, that equivocation is not falsehood. Julia imagined
that she would be as unwilling to tell an untruth
as Emily herself could be, but she did not consider
that a habit of equivocation is as obnoxious as
falsehood itself, to that nice sense of honour, which
can alone preserve the mind pure and untainted.
She had not been taught, with sufficient care, to
know, that, though she told a part of what was true,
she was yet equally guilty of the crime of falsehood,
as long as what she said was dictated by a wish to
deceive. Emily, though so much younger, had,
therefore, arrived at much greater maturity in the art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
of reasoning, and had imbibed, even at that early
age, an ardent love of truth, and a keen contempt
for the meanness of deceit; and she replied, in a
quiet but steady voice: "Though I did behave well
in school, I should still be cheating, if I made my
mamma believe that I got a ticket for good behaviour,
and that would take away all the pleasure of
the visit;" and, as she spoke, she took the ticket
from the place in which she had deposited it, with
the intention of giving it to its right owner; but,
whilst she held it in her hand, the parlour door opened,
and Mrs. Osman entered the room. The moment
Emily saw her mother, the recollection of her
own fault rose to her mind, and checked the pleasure
with which she would otherwise have welcomed her
return, and the constraint of her manner was immediately
observed by her watchful parent. "What is
the matter, Emily, my dear?" asked she anxiously.
"I see by the ticket in your hand, that you have succeeded
in gaining your promised reward, and yet
you do not appear to be in your usual spirits." Emily's
countenance became still more agitated, whilst
the colour of her face and neck, the skin of which
readily told, by its varying hue, the different fluctuations
of her feelings, proved that a severe conflict
was passing within. To allow her mother to remain
in the error of supposing the ticket to be her own,
was impossible: yet how was she to explain the fact
of its being Julia's, without exposing the fault of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
friend? for she knew that her mamma's first question
would be, "what had she to do with Julia's
ticket?"</p>

<p>"What is the matter, my dear?" again asked
the anxious mother, "is there any objection, which
I am ignorant of, to your going to Mrs. Cassy's
to-day?"</p>

<p>"Mamma, I have no right at all to go," replied
Emily, almost trembling with agitation as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Why not? You got your ticket yesterday I
see."</p>

<p>"No, mamma, I did not! This is not my ticket."</p>

<p>"What ticket is it then? for I have all your
others." Emily was silent, and her agitation increased
to a degree that was very painful to observe;
but Julia, who possessed a mind, which, though some
noxious weeds had been permitted to spring up in it,
was yet adorned with the rich and beautiful flowers
of generosity and affection, saw and understood her
distress, and determined to relieve her even at
the pain of exposing herself; and therefore said,
"I will tell you, ma'am, all about it; for, although it
was not very good in me, it was so very good in
Emily, that I know you will reward her for it."
She then related the circumstance of the ticket very
simply, without attempting either to excuse or extenuate
her own conduct, though she did full justice to
the integrity and honourable behaviour of her friend.
Whilst Julia was speaking, Emily watched her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
mother's countenance with an expression of great
anxiety, and the moment she had ceased, she turned to
her and said, in a timid and supplicating voice,
"Mamma, do not be angry with Julia!"</p>

<p>"As Julia is now to be so short a time among us,
Emily, I will take no further notice of her conduct,
but will leave it to the animadversions of her own
breast," replied Mrs. Osman, gravely.</p>

<p>"But you will let Emily go to Mrs. Cassy's," said
Julia eagerly. "You will surely, Mrs. Osman, reward
her for behaving so well."</p>

<p>"I hope, Julia, that though Emily is so young a
child, she yet knows too well that it is her duty to
be honest, to expect any other reward for being so,
than that which she has already secured to herself."</p>

<p>"But it is so trifling a fault that she lost her ticket
for," remonstrated Julia.</p>

<p>"It was indeed a trifle, and her having so very
nearly succeeded this time, gives me hopes that she
will be wholly successful the next time."</p>

<p>"O! yes, I am sure, ma'am, if you will let her go
to-day she will be more careful the next time."</p>

<p>"I am of a different opinion, Julia," replied Mrs.
Osman, smiling; "and believe that this lesson,
which I now hope will be of service to Emily as
long as she lives, would be lost entirely, were she
not to suffer the punishment for her fault that she
knows it deserves."</p>

<p>"But ought she not to be rewarded for being good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
too? and if she is not allowed to go she will have no
reward at all."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, I shall," interrupted Emily, who read,
in her mother's countenance, the approbation which
she felt of her conscientious conduct, "I shall have
reward enough."</p>

<p>"Yes, Emily," replied her mother, "you will
have the best of all rewards, a self-approving mind;
and I should be sorry to weaken its effects by seeming
to think that any further reward is necessary for
your having done your duty." But Emily showed
that she did not consider any thing more necessary
to reward her for the part which she had acted, and
she saw her friend go to pay her visit to Mrs. Cassy
without a sigh; for though exceedingly sorry not to
accompany her, she felt an inward consciousness of
having acted properly, that made every thing appear
cheerful and pleasant around her. The day passed
delightfully, therefore, though no particular pains
were taken to amuse her; for her mother was afraid,
if she indulged in any extraordinary expressions of
approbation, she might lead her little girl to imagine
that she had performed some wonderful act of virtue,
instead of having merely done her duty. What Emily
had done, however, had been done purely because
she knew it to be right, and not for the sake of admiration
or reward. The approbation of her own conscience was
all that she required; and, with such a
companion, she felt no difficulty in spending a delightful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Christmas day. Her voice, when she sung,
had never, to her own ear at least, sounded so well;
nor had her feet ever before fallen so lightly on the
floor, as they did when she skipped about; and as
to her little kitten, though it had brought her into
trouble, it was now forgiven, and they ran about
the room together, as if trying to show, by their
light and sportive movements, how graceful and
beautiful a thing is the union of childhood and innocence.</p>

<h2>THE QUILTING.</h2>

<p>"Only think, Charlotte," said Marianne Glanvil,
on entering the chamber where her sister was endeavouring
to get through a warm afternoon in August,
by lolling on the bed in a loose gown,&mdash;"Susan
Davison has just been here with an invitation for us."</p>

<p><i>Charlotte.</i>&mdash;And pray, who is Susan Davison?</p>

<p><i>Marianne.</i>&mdash;The daughter of farmer Davison up
the creek. We met her at Trenchard's the day we
were obliged to drink tea there.</p>

<p><i>Charlotte.</i>&mdash;I wonder how you can remember their
names, or theirselves either: I am sure I do not know
one of these people from another, and I never wish
to know.</p>

<p><i>Marianne.</i>&mdash;But this Susan Davison is really not
so bad. She is diffident enough, to be sure, but is
rather less awkward and uncouth than the generality
of country girls.</p>

<p><i>Charlotte.</i>&mdash;To me they are all alike; I do not
profess to understand the varieties of the species.</p>

<p><i>Marianne.</i>&mdash;Well, I was going to tell you, that
after a sitting of half an hour, Susan Davison, as she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
rose to depart, uttered an invitation to her quilting
to-morrow.</p>

<p><i>Charlotte.</i>&mdash;And what is a quilting?</p>

<p><i>Marianne.</i>&mdash;Now, I am sure you must have heard
of quiltings. It is an assemblage of all the females
in the neighbourhood, for the purpose of quilting, in
one afternoon, a whole patch-work bed-cover.</p>

<p><i>Charlotte.</i>&mdash;I shall certainly not go. I never quilted
any thing in my life, and I hate the sight of a
patch-work bed-cover.</p>

<p><i>Marianne.</i>&mdash;But my father and mother were in the
parlour, and promised at once that we should both go.</p>

<p><i>Charlotte.</i>&mdash;How vexatious! Was it not enough,
after being educated at the most genteel boarding
school in the city, and accustomed only to polished
society, to be brought to live at this remote place,
where my father has thought proper to purchase an
iron-foundry, but we are required also to be civil to
the country people, and interchange visits with them?
I almost think my father intends being a candidate
for the assembly next election, or he never would
take the trouble to make himself agreeable to the
farmers and their families.</p>

<p><i>Marianne.</i>&mdash;You know, he thinks it is always desirable
to be popular with our neighbours.</p>

<p><i>Charlotte.</i>&mdash;That is what I shall never be, unless
my neighbours are popular with me.</p>

<p><i>Marianne.</i>&mdash;Now, for my part, I like very well to
astonish them by the elegance of my dress, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
by my various accomplishments. I am going to put
my lace sleeves in my new palmyrene frock, purposely
to wear at this quilting.</p>

<p><i>Charlotte.</i>&mdash;It is well worth your while to take
that trouble, when the worst dress you have is too
good for such company. I shall do quite the contrary,
to let them see how little I care for them.</p>

<p><i>Marianne.</i>&mdash;Then you will displease my father.</p>

<p><i>Charlotte.</i>&mdash;Is it necessary that he should know it?
I am sure my mother will never tell him, and for
her own part, she never opposes us in any thing.
However, if I must be at this quilting, I shall take
care to make the time as short as possible, for I will
go late and come away early.</p>

<p><i>Marianne.</i>&mdash;Susan Davison said, she hoped we
would be there by two o'clock, which I suppose will
be the usual hour of assembling.</p>

<p><i>Charlotte.</i>&mdash;Two o'clock! Go to a party at two
o'clock! Why the wild Indians could not be more
uncouth on such an occasion!</p>

<p><i>Marianne.</i>&mdash;I doubt whether the wild Indians
have any quiltings. But go we must, as my father
and mother at once accepted the invitation for us.</p>

<p><i>Charlotte.</i>&mdash;How unlucky that they happened to
be present!</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>The next day, between one and two o'clock, the
Miss Glanvils saw numerous young girls ride by on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
horseback, on their way to Andrew Davison's
which was about two miles from the iron works.
"Now," remarked Marianne, "these poor girls
must have hurried to get their dinners over before
twelve, that they might have time to be drest and
mounted by one o'clock."</p>

<p>"But why," asked Charlotte, "do they all wear
striped linen skirts with silk bodies and sleeves?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied Marianne, "you surely know that
those are their riding-skirts; a sort of petticoat made
of thick homespun linen, which they tie on over the
skirts of their silk frocks to keep them clean while
riding."</p>

<p>"You seem to be well versed in all their ways,"
said Charlotte, contemptuously.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock, however, before the Miss Glanvils
were ready to set out for the quilting, as Charlotte
took her usual afternoon's nap, and Marianne
occupied two hours in dressing; arraying herself in
her straw-coloured palmyrene with lace sleeves, and
ornamenting her hair (which was a mass of curls)
with a profusion of yellow flowers and gauze ribbon.
She put on all her jewels, and sewed her white kid
gloves to her lace sleeves, which were confined at
the wrists with three bracelets each. She had embroidered
silk stockings, and white satin shoes, and
threw over her shoulders a splendid scarf of various
colours. This dress she had worn at a boarding
school ball, shortly before the family removed into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
the country. Nothing could be a greater contrast
than the appearance of the two sisters as they got
into the carriage; for Charlotte persevered in going
to the quilting in a pink gingham, her hair merely
tucked behind her ears with two side combs.</p>

<p>Their mother slightly disapproved of both their
dresses, but as soon as they were gone thought of
something else.</p>

<p>In a short time the Miss Glanvils arrived at Andrew
Davison's, and found the quilting going on in
the vast stone barn, which had been put in order for
the purpose. They were conducted to the barn by
young Davison, the farmer's eldest son, who had
assisted them out of the carriage, and were met at
the entrance by Susan, who received them with
much respect, as being the two greatest strangers
of the party. The guests were all sitting round the
quilting frame busily at work. They looked with
some surprise at the two sisters so very differently
habited, but no remark was made, even in a whisper.</p>

<p>Charlotte declined taking a chair at the frame,
saying, she knew nothing about quilting, and seated
herself in a most inconvenient place at the head of
the quilt, very much in the way of a young girl that
could not draw out her arm in consequence of the
vicinity of Miss Glanvil, who saw that she incommoded
her, but made no offer to move. Marianne,
however, advanced to the frame, and dislodging
three or four girls, who rose to make room for her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
and her immense frock, which was flounced far
above her knees, she took out of her reticule an elegant
little ivory work box, and laying down beside
it a perfumed and embroidered cambric handkerchief,
and a tortoise-shell fan, she most pompously
set to work with her gloves on. She found this way
of quilting very inconvenient, and as her gloves could
only be taken off by ripping them from her sleeves,
she begged, with an air of the most condescending
affability, to be excused from the quilting; and then
removed to a seat beside her sister. Charlotte threw
herself back in her chair, and putting her feet on the
bars of another, sat drumming with her fingers on
the quilt and humming a French song.</p>

<p>The other guests, though they all had too much civility
to stare as steadily as the Miss Glanvils expected,
stole occasional glances of surprise and curiosity at
the sisters; one so overdrest and affecting so much
condescension, the other insulting them by coming in
dishabille, and setting at defiance even the most common
rules of politeness.</p>

<p>There sat at the quilt a very pretty young girl,
with her dark hair curling on her temples in natural
ringlets. She wore a white muslin frock, with a
worked cape, and a broad pink ribbon on her neck,
which was beautifully white. Her figure was very
good, though rather plump than otherwise, and her
cheeks had the bloom of roses. She seemed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
acquainted with all the company, and talked pleasantly
and sensibly to every one, without any air of
superiority, or any affectation of graciousness. She
quilted assiduously and neatly, and assisted with
great skill in the various operations of rolling, stretching,
and pinning the quilt. The sisters did not distinguish
and did not ask her surname, but they heard
every one call her Fanny.</p>

<p>Shortly after the arrival of the Miss Glanvils, the
two younger daughters of farmer Davison, on a signal
from their sister Susan, went to a table which
stood in a corner of the barn, and removing a cloth
which had been lightly thrown over it, disclosed several
large custards and three sorts of fruit pies,
peach, plum, and apple. The pastry being already
cut up, was very soon transferred to as many plates
as there were guests, every plate containing a piece
of custard and three slices of pie, one of each sort.</p>

<p>These plates were handed to the company on
small waiters, by Jane and Mary Davison, while
Susan remained near the quilt and invited her guests
to eat; every one being expected to taste all the varieties
on their plate. The Glanvils exchanged significant
looks.</p>

<p>"Is it puff-paste?" said Charlotte, speaking for
the first time, and touching a piece of pie with the
point of her knife.</p>

<p>"I believe not," replied Susan, colouring, "none
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
of our family understand making puff-paste; but I
know mother did her best to have this as short and
crisp as possible. Please to try some of it."</p>

<p>"I thank you," answered Charlotte, coldly, "I
am very careful of my teeth, and I am afraid to risk
their coming in contact with hard substances."</p>

<p>She commenced on a piece of the plum pie, but
pointedly avoided the paste, eating out all the fruit,
and conspicuously laying aside the crust. Marianne,
however, found the pastry so palatable, that she
could scarcely refrain from eating the whole that
was on her plate, and she was not surprised to overhear
the young girl they called Fanny, praising it to
another who sat next to her.</p>

<p>The presence of the Miss Glanvils evidently threw
a restraint on the whole company, except Fanny,
who, to the great surprise of the sisters, appeared
perfectly at her ease all the time, and not in the least
awed by their superiority.</p>

<p>"Who can that girl be?" whispered Marianne to
Charlotte.</p>

<p>"Some vulgar thing like the rest," answered
Charlotte.</p>

<p>"I do not think her vulgar," said Marianne.</p>

<p>"I know no reason for supposing her otherwise,"
rejoined Charlotte. "You know the proverb, 'Birds
of a feather flock together.' See how familiar she
is with all of them. She knows every one of their
names. She must have been born and brought up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
with them. By their talk she has been here since
two o'clock."</p>

<p>About sunset the quilt was completed. The chalk-marks,
and the clippings of thread, were then carefully
brushed off; a dozen scissors were employed in
ripping it from the frame, and two dozen hands
afterwards spread it to the full size, and shook it till
the lofty roof of the barn echoed the sound; which
sound brought in near twenty young men who had
been lingering about the barn-door for the last half
hour, none of them having courage to venture within,
except Susan Davison's two brothers. They were
all clean shaved, and in their best clothes; some
even had their hair curled, and the Miss Glanvils
now found occasion to whisper and titter at the costume
of the country beaux, particularly at their very
fine waistcoats.</p>

<p>Soon after, one of the little girls came to announce
that supper was ready, which intelligence was repeated
by Susan to the Miss Glanvils; and her two
brothers now came forward, each with a low bow,
and offered their arms to conduct the young ladies
to the house, as they had been previously tutored by
their sister. The Miss Glanvils, however, took no
notice of the offered arms, and the young men,
much abashed, walked silently beside them. Fanny,
escorted by the old farmer, who had accosted her at
the barn-door with great cordiality, joined about
midway in the procession, and they all walked to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the house, where supper was set out in the largest
room.</p>

<p>The table was of immense size, with at each end
a waiter, containing an equipage for tea and coffee;
Mrs. Davison presiding at one and Susan at the
other. The centre ornament was a roast pig, flanked
by dishes of stewed fowls, and the rest of the
table was covered with plates of pound cake, gingerbread,
short cakes, doughnuts, rusk, preserves,
apple-sauce, fried ham, cream-cheese, and sage-cheese;
there being always four plates of each particular
article, that a share of all the various good
things might be within the reach of every one at
table. William and Thomas Davison, assisted by
several others of the least bashful and most alert of
the young men, stood behind the chairs with waiters
in their hands, and helped the females; their
father being the only man that took a seat at the table.</p>

<p>The Miss Glanvils sat together in solemn state;
Marianne carefully employed in defending her finery
from the expected inroads of the various things that
were handed about in her neighbourhood; but very
much inclined to eat heartily of many of the tempting
viands that were before her, had she not been
checked by the disapproving looks of her sister.</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that Charlotte consented to
be helped to any thing, and uniformly after tasting it
laid each article on the side of her plate, as if unfit
to eat. After she had taken a sip of tea she drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
back with a look of horror, and declaring it to be
green tea, and that she would not drink a cup of it
for the world, she pushed it away from her as far as
possible.</p>

<p>She then requested some black tea, but unluckily
there was none in the house; and Mrs. Davison,
much disconcerted, apologized in great confusion,
saying, that as black tea was not used in the neighbourhood,
she did not believe there was any to be
had at the store, or she would send and get some.
She then asked if Miss Glanvil would take a cup
of coffee, but Charlotte replied that though extravagantly
fond of coffee in the morning, (always drinking
three cups,) she could not possibly touch it at
night.</p>

<p>"Did you never drink green tea?" asked the farmer.
"Certainly," she replied in a disdainful tone,
"I drank it always till black tea became fashionable."</p>

<p>"Then," said the farmer, smiling, "if you have
been drinking it all your life till very lately, perhaps
you might, if you were to try, make out once
more to swallow a cup of it on a pinch, and be none
the worse for it."</p>

<p>Charlotte looked much displeased, and sat back
in her chair, obstinately determined not to touch
the green tea. Of course all the Davison family
felt and looked extremely uncomfortable, and they
would have been glad when the Miss Glanvils finally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
rose from table, which they did shortly after, only
that the rest of the company thought it necessary to
follow their example, and the feast prepared with so
much care and trouble was concluded in half the
usual time. The female guests were conducted to
an adjoining room, while the supper table was cleared
away and then re-set exactly as before for the
young men.</p>

<p>Singing being proposed, Fanny was invited "to
favour them with a song." She consented at once,
and inquired which of her songs they would have.
The simple and beautiful Scotch air of the Bonnie
Boat was named, and she sung it with a sweet clear
voice and excellent taste, though no attempt at ornament.
The Miss Glanvils exchanged glances and
whispers.</p>

<p>The two young ladies were then respectfully
requested to sing. Charlotte refused at once, declaring
that it was impossible to sing without an
instrument: but Marianne, eager to display her
knowledge of fashionable music, complied readily,
and gave "Una voce poco fa," with what she considered
wonderful execution. As soon as she had
finished, Charlotte perceiving that the company,
though greatly amazed at first, had become much
fatigued by this unseasonable exhibition of Italian
singing, and that it had not given the least pleasure
to any one, ill-naturedly proposed to her sister to try
"Di piacer," which she also got through, to the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
annoyance of the young men who had long before
come in from the supper room, and who were certainly
not of a class to relish such songs as are unintelligible
to all but the initiated.</p>

<p>A black man now appeared with a fiddle, and took
his seat in one of the windows; there was a reinforcement
of beaux, and the Miss Glanvils found that
a dance was to be the next amusement. Marianne
remarked, in a group of young men that had just
entered the room, one of remarkably genteel appearance
and extremely handsome. "Charlotte," said
she, "look at that young gentleman in black, talking
to Tom Davison."</p>

<p>"I see no <em>gentleman</em> in the room," replied Charlotte,
"and I do not know Tom Davison from the
other clowns."</p>

<p>"Oh! but this, I am certain, is really a gentleman,"
said Marianne, "I wish he would ask me to
dance."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Charlotte, "would you actually
join in a dance with these people? Could you
stand up with them and give them your hand? And
above all things, would you make one in a <i>country-dance</i>,
for of course they know nothing about cotillions?"</p>

<p>"Yes I would," answered Marianne, "with such
a partner as that young gentleman in black. And
then, when they see <em>my</em> French steps, how ashamed
they will be of their own shuffling and prancing."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Just then, Tom Davison, observing Marianne's
eyes fixed with evident approbation on the stranger
in black, brought him up and introduced him to her
as Captain Selman; and on his requesting the pleasure
of dancing with her, she immediately consented
with great satisfaction. Tom Davison then, with a
low bow and a look of much embarrassment, ventured
to make the same request of Charlotte, who refused
with an air of such unequivocal contempt, that
the youth determined in his own mind to leave her to
herself for the remainder of the evening.</p>

<p>The musician made three scrapes on his fiddle
as a signal for every one to take their places. "Of
course," said Marianne, "we go to the top," and
Captain Selman led her to the head of the country
dance that was forming, while she lamented to him the
sad necessity of being obliged to join in such a dance,
saying that she must depend on him to give her some
idea of the figure; and adding that he would find her
an apt scholar, as she was always considered very
quick at learning every thing.</p>

<p>The musician gave a loud stamp with his foot,
and then struck up New-Jersey; but observing that
Charlotte stopped her ears in horror, Marianne begged
of her partner to go and ask the man if he could not
play something less barbarous. The man replied that
New-Jersey was the dancing tune he was most used
to, but that he could play the Morning Star and Fisher's
Hornpipe quite as well. Marianne said that she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
had heard her mother speak of dancing these things
when she was a girl, and therefore she was sure they
must be abominable.</p>

<p>At last, after much sending of Captain Selman
backwards and forwards, and proposing tunes which
she knew the poor fiddler had never even heard of,
it was ascertained that he thought he could play
"The Campbells are coming," having <em>catched</em> it, as
he said, the last time he was in town.</p>

<p>Captain Selman undertook to instruct the company
in the figure, which he did with great good humour,
and they actually learnt it with a quickness that surprised
Marianne. She went down the dance exhibiting
all her most difficult steps, and affecting a wonderful
gracefulness in every motion. However, when
she got to the bottom, suspecting that this display had
not excited quite as much admiration as she had expected,
she professed great fatigue, and threw herself
into a chair, declaring she could not dance another
step; and knowing that in consequence Captain Selman
could do no less than stand by and converse
with her till the set was over.</p>

<p>"I do not see Susan Davison dancing," said Marianne,
"she has been sitting all the time beside my
sister. She is rather a pretty girl; I wonder none of
the young men have taken her out."</p>

<p>"I made my bow to her soon after I came in," replied
the Captain, "but she declines dancing this
evening, alleging that, being in her own house, she is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
unwilling to take a place that might be occupied by
one of her friends."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Marianne, abruptly, "your next
partner will be the young person they call Fanny, as
she is certainly rather well-looking. There she is,
about the middle of the dance, with a broad pink
ribbon round her neck. Indeed, though my sister is
of a contrary opinion, I should be almost inclined to
think this Fanny something of a lady, only that she is
so sociable with these people. To be sure, I have
tried myself to be affable this evening, but I find it
such an irksome task that I believe it will be my last
attempt. Now it seems quite natural to this said
Fanny, which proves, as my sister Charlotte says,
that she is in reality no better than the rest. We
think she must be the daughter of one of these country
store-keepers, and that she has now and then had
the benefit of a fortnight's polishing in the city, while
her father was buying his spring goods."</p>

<p>Captain Selman smiled, and was going to reply,
when Charlotte joined them, saying in a most peevish
voice, "Marianne, do you intend staying here all
night? If you do, you must stay by yourself. I
have just heard our carriage drive up, for I charged
William to come for us early, and I am dying to get
away."</p>

<p>Marianne, who would willingly have stayed longer,
was about to remonstrate, but finding that the Captain
had escaped from her side, she felt less reluctant to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
go. Charlotte made her exit without ceremony, but
Marianne purposely loitered till the dance was over,
that she might make her departure the more conspicuous,
and produce a great effect by her elegant
manner of taking leave. She then walked up to
Mrs. Davison, and overwhelming the good woman
with curtseyings, bowings, compliments and flourishes,
she left the room, accompanied by Susan, to
the chamber in which their shawls and calashes had
been deposited.</p>

<p>They were put into the carriage by Tom Davison,
as his last effort of civility. And it was resolved
next day by the family in council, that the Miss Glanvils
should on no future occasion be invited; for, as
Mrs. Davison remarked, they held their heads quite
too high, and their airs were unbearable.</p>

<p>As they drove home, Charlotte, in the most unqualified
terms, expressed her disgust at the quilting-party,
and every thing connected with it. Marianne
acknowledged that the whole concern, as she called
it, was very ungenteel, but still not quite so bad as she
had expected. She said that in her opinion Captain
Selman would be presentable even in good society,
and expressed her surprise at finding an officer at a
quilting.</p>

<p>"Pho," said Charlotte, "he is only a militia captain,
of course."</p>

<p>"No," replied Marianne, "I am very sure he is
no such thing. If he were a militia officer, he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
undoubtedly have come to the party in full uniform,
booted and spurred, with epaulette, and chapeau and
feather, his sword at his side, and his sash spread
out over his body as broad as possible, and pinned up
in a peak before and behind, as I have heard my
mother describe their costume. No, no; this officer
is in the regular army, and from something he said,
I know he was educated at West Point."</p>

<p>"Well," said Charlotte, "I doubt his being a man
of fashion after all. I observed him, after he left
you, speaking familiarly to that Fanny as if they
were well acquainted. However, he did not seem
to ask her to dance, but he paid that compliment to
one that sat near the door, a poor bashful-looking
girl, the worst dressed and least attractive in the
room."</p>

<p>The next day but one was Sunday. The church,
which was about three miles off, had been shut up,
undergoing repairs ever since Mr. Glanvil had removed
to the iron-works, but it was now again opened
for worship, and the Glanvil family all repaired
thither in their carriage. On this occasion, Charlotte
was as elegantly drest as her sister; for having satisfied
her perverseness by going in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dishabille</i> to the
quilting, she determined now to astonish the congregation
by a great display of finery at church.</p>

<p>As they passed up the middle aisle, the eyes of
the Miss Glanvils were attracted immediately to a
handsome pew near the pulpit; in which pew they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
saw Captain Selman, accompanied by Fanny, and
an elderly gentleman and lady, both of remarkably
genteel and dignified appearance. The two sisters,
at the same moment, pulled each other's sleeves significantly.
They thought the service very long, and
as soon as church was over, Marianne asked her
father if he knew the occupants of the pew that was
lined with blue moreen. He replied, "They are
the governor and his family. They have been travelling
all summer, and only returned last week. I
called yesterday to see them as I passed their house,
which is about five miles from ours." "Is it possible,"
exclaimed Charlotte, "that Fanny can be the
governor's daughter!" "Is Captain Selman the governor's
son?" cried Marianne.</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. Glanvil. "The governor's
name, you know, is Milford. Captain Selman is the
son of Mrs. Milford's first marriage, and Miss Fanny
Milford is his half-sister."</p>

<p>At the church-gate the governor's carriage was
waiting beside Mr. Glanvil's, and Mr. Milford stopped
with his family to introduce them to Mrs. Glanvil
and her daughters. The Miss Glanvils looked much
embarrassed. Charlotte was ashamed that Miss
Milford should have witnessed her unamiable behaviour
at the quilting, and Marianne was shocked at
recollecting the freedom with which she had talked
to Captain Selman of his step-sister. Their confusion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
was so evident, that the Captain and Fanny,
when introduced to the Miss Glanvils, avoided making
any allusion to having met them at farmer Davison's.</p>

<p>But little was said on either side, and the disconcerted
sisters were glad to take refuge in the carriage.</p>

<p>On their way home, Charlotte expressed her surprise
at the condescension of the governor's family
in deigning to be on visiting terms with the farmer's.</p>

<p>"And why not?" said Mr. Glanvil. "Andrew
Davison is a good citizen, and a respectable, sensible
and worthy man; and his children, though he
has wisely forborne to make any attempt at giving
them what is called a fashionable education, are
by no means coarse. The old-fashioned plainness
of decent country people is not vulgarity; and if
they are ignorant of the conventional forms of city
society, they generally make amends by having a
large share of that natural civility which springs
from good feeling; and it is easy in our intercourse
with them to avoid imitating such of their habits and
expressions as are at variance with our standard of
refinement. As fellow-citizens, their rights are the
same as ours, and, like us, they call no man master.
Not one of them would bend his knee to any monarch
upon earth.</p>

<p>"Governor Milford has lived in this part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
country nearly his whole life, and is, of course, acquainted
with all the old settlers, of whom Andrew
Davison is one. And he has very judiciously brought
up his family in the mutual interchange of civilities
with all his respectable neighbours, knowing that
nothing is ever lost by cultivating the good opinion of
those among whom our lot is cast."</p>

<p>"I suspect, after all," said Charlotte, ill-naturedly,
"that the governor's affability, and that of his children,
originate in the expectation of securing the
votes of farmer Davison and his sons at the next election."</p>

<p>"You are entirely mistaken," replied Mr. Glanvil.
"Governor Milford and the Davisons, though
old friends, are of opposite parties. They did not
vote for him at the last election, and he has declined
being a candidate for the next."</p>

<p>Next day, the Glanvils were visited by the governor,
with his wife and daughter. Captain Selman
did not accompany them, having set out to
return to his station. Mr. and Mrs. Glanvil were
not at home, but the young ladies overwhelmed the
Milford family with civilities; Charlotte, in particular,
was absolutely obsequious in her attentions.</p>

<p>Upon farther acquaintance, they found that Fanny
Milford had been educated in the city, and was quite
as accomplished as either of themselves, though she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
had too much good sense to make any unseasonable
display. Her example was not lost upon Marianne,
who improved greatly by occasional intercourse with
this amiable girl. We wish we could say the same
of Charlotte; but pride is of all faults one of the
most difficult to conquer, as it is seldom found except
in persons of weak understanding. Sensible people
are never offensively proud.</p>

<h2>THE SOUVENIR.</h2>

<p>It was the afternoon of Christmas eve. The
weather was delightfully mild for the season, and the
sky without a cloud. The streets of Philadelphia
were unusually crowded, and the whole appearance
of the city was gay and animated. The fancy stores
were resplendent with elegant ribbons, laces, scarfs,
and reticules, and the shops for artificial flowers,
made a display which rivaled nature in her most
blooming season. It was a pleasing spectacle to see
so many parents leading their children, all with happy
faces; some full of hope, and others replete with
satisfaction; some going to buy Christmas gifts,
others carrying home those already purchased. Mr.
Woodley went out with his two boys to choose little
presents for them, regretting that Amelia, his eldest
daughter, was obliged to remain at home in consequence
of a severe cold.</p>

<p>They soon entered a toy-shop, where Charles
made choice of a toy representing William Tell
directing his arrow toward the apple on the head of
his son, who stood blindfold at a little distance, and,
by pulling a string, the arrow took flight and struck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the apple off the boy's head. This Charles called
a very sensible toy, and his father bought him also
a box containing little wooden houses, churches,
and trees, which could be so arranged as to form a
village.</p>

<p>Oswald, who was long since past the age of toys,
selected, at a neighbouring shop, a very pretty and
curious little writing apparatus of the purest and
most transparent white marble. It looked like a very
small vase, but it contained an ink-stand, sand-box,
wafer-box, a candlestick for a wax taper, and a
receptacle for pens: all nicely fitting into each other,
and so ingeniously contrived as to occupy the smallest
space possible.</p>

<p>"Oswald," said Mr. Woodley, "you have chosen
so well for yourself, that I will leave to you the selection
of a present for your sister Amelia. Oswald
thought of many things before he could fix on any
one that he supposed would be useful or agreeable
to Amelia. She had already a handsome work-box,
a bead-purse, and a case of little perfume bottles.
For a moment his choice inclined to one of the elegant
reticules he saw in a window they were just
passing, and then he recollected that Amelia could
make very beautiful reticules herself. At last, he
fixed on a Souvenir, and wondered that the thought
had not struck him before, as Amelia drew very
well, and was an enthusiastic admirer of fine engravings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
They repaired to a neighbouring book-store, where,
amid a variety of splendid Souvenirs, Oswald selected
for his sister one of those that he considered the
most beautiful, and had the pleasure of carrying it
home to her.</p>

<p>To describe the delight of Amelia on receiving
this elegant present, is impossible. She spread a
clean handkerchief over her lap before she drew the
book from its case, that it might not be soiled in the
slightest degree, and she removed to a distance from
the fire lest the cover should be warped by the heat.
After she had eagerly looked all through it, she commenced
again, and examined the plates with the most
minute attention. She then showed them to her little
brother and sister, carefully, however, keeping the
book in her own hands.</p>

<p>"Amelia," said Oswald, "I know a boy that would
be very happy to examine this Souvenir. He has no
opportunity of seeing any thing of the kind, except
by gazing at the windows of the book-stores."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;And who is this boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;His father, who has seen better days,
is an assistant in our school, and the boy himself is
one of the pupils. His name is Edwin Lovel. He
has a most extraordinary genius for drawing, though
he has never had the means of cultivating it to any
extent. He is a very sensible boy, and I like him
better than any one in the school. His mother must
be a nice woman, for though their income is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
small, Edwin always makes a genteel appearance,
and is uniformly clean and neat. He is also extremely
handsome. All his leisure time is devoted to drawing.
He first began on the slate, when he was only
four years old, and had nothing else to draw on till
he was nine or ten. Now, he saves what little money
he has, for the purpose of buying paper and pencils.
He has no box of colours, but draws only in Indian
ink, which he does most beautifully. He never likes
to see any thing wasted that can be used for drawing,
and is even glad to get the cover of a letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;You remind me of the French artist
Godfrey's fine picture of the Battle of Pultowa, which
he drew, while in prison, on the backs of letters pasted
together; using, instead of Indian ink or colours,
the soot of the stove-pipe mixed with water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Well, Edwin Lovel is not quite so much
at a loss for drawing materials, for he has a cake of
Indian ink and four camel's hair pencils. He draws
with a pen beautiful title-pages, decorated with vignettes,
for his copy-books and ciphering-books; and
the boys pay him for ornamenting their writing-pieces.
He was for a long time very unwilling to take money
for those things, but we finally prevailed on him,
though with great difficulty. He passes most of his
evenings in drawing; that is, when he has any candle
of his own, for he will not, even in the pursuit of
his favourite gratification, cause the slightest additional
expense to his parents, who find it very hard to
live on his father's small salary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;What an excellent boy he must be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Last Saturday afternoon, I thought I
would go for him and take him to see some very fine
pictures which were to be sold at auction on Monday.
The door was opened by a half-grown black girl,
(their only servant,) who was probably not accustomed
to admitting visiters, and, therefore, knew no better
than to show me at once up stairs to Edwin's
chamber; a very small place, perfectly clean, but
furnished in the most economical manner. There
was no fire in the room. Edwin was sitting at a little
pine table with his great coat on, and his feet
enveloped in an old muff of his mother's to keep
them warm. He was busily engaged in copying a
head of Decatur from a China pitcher, improving on
it so greatly as to make it a very fine drawing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;Poor fellow! had he nothing better to
copy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Why, I asked him that question, but he
confessed that he was at so great a loss for models
that he was glad to imitate any thing he could get;
and that, having no instructer, he knew no better way
to pick up a little knowledge of the general principles
of the art, than by copying every thing that
came in his way, provided it was not absolutely bad.
I then reminded him that, as he could make admirable
sketches from his own imagination, I thought he
need not copy at all; but he disclaimed all pretensions
to designing well, and then said that, even if his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
original attempts were tolerably successful, as outlines,
it was only by drawing from prints or pictures
that he could acquire a just idea of keeping, or of the
distribution of light and shadow. He showed me,
however, several original drawings, which my father
would say evinced an extraordinary degree of talent,
and some admirable copies, though many of them
were taken from very coarse prints for want of better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;How very glad he would be to have
this Souvenir to draw from.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;He would, indeed. But that Souvenir
cost three dollars, and I do not suppose that he ever
had three dollars in his life, poor boy&mdash;I mean three
dollars at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;I will willingly lend it to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;He has so little time to draw, that it
would be a great while before he could return it; or
rather, he would be so uneasy at keeping it long, that
I know he would send it back before he had half done
with it. And, besides, he would have no satisfaction
in drawing from <em>your book</em>, as he would be in continual
fear of dropping his brush on one of the leaves,
or of accidentally injuring it in some way or other.
He is very unwilling to borrow any thing that is new
or valuable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;What a pity that a boy of so much
genius should find any difficulties in his way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;There are too many similar instances.
Some of the most distinguished artists of the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
age have been obliged, in early life, to struggle with
indigence, and, indeed, with absolute poverty, much
as Edwin Lovel is now doing.</p>

<p>The next morning, Amelia said to her brother as
soon as she found him alone, "Oswald, I wish to
ask you one question. When we receive a present,
does it not become our own?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;And we are at liberty to do exactly
what we please with it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Precisely&mdash;only I think we had better
not destroy it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;Of course, not&mdash;but we may give it
away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Why&mdash;I do not know&mdash;I should not
like to give away a present received from a valued
friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;But if, in giving it away, you make the
person on whom you bestow it more happy than you
yourself could possibly be made by keeping it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;If you were sure that that would be
the case&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;Oh! I am very sure&mdash;I can answer
for myself. Therefore, dear brother, I beg your
acceptance of my Souvenir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Why, Amelia, your kindness surprises
me. You know I have already a Christmas gift;
the beautiful writing case that my father bought for
me yesterday. I cannot take your Souvenir.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;Dear Oswald, for once allow me to make
you a present. It is the first time in my life I have
had it in my power to offer you any thing of consequence.
I shall be so happy, if you accept it&mdash;There
it is, (<i>laying the Souvenir on Oswald's knee.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;But, Amelia, how can you part so soon
with your beautiful Souvenir? You were so delighted
with it last evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;I know every thing in it&mdash;I examined all
the plates with the greatest attention, and I read it
through before I went to bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;(<i>smiling.</i>)&mdash;Well, Amelia, though you
are so generous as to make me the owner of the
Souvenir, you know it will still remain in the house.
I will put it carefully away in my little book case,
and whenever you wish to look at it, just tell me so,
and you shall have it at any time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;(<i>looking disappointed.</i>)&mdash;But, Oswald,
are you going to keep it always?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Always, as the gift of my loving sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;But I do not <em>insist</em> on your keeping it
for ever, dear Oswald. You may give it away
again&mdash;I shall not be the least offended if you give it
away, provided you bestow it properly. Indeed, I
would rather you should give it away than not&mdash;and
as soon as possible, too&mdash;this very day, if you choose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Surely, Amelia, you have a very strange
way of making a present; desiring it to be given
away again immediately.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;Why, Oswald, you know you do not
draw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;No, indeed, to my great regret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;And, if you did, my father would always
take care that you should be well supplied with
models.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;I suppose he would, as he never lets
us want for any thing that could add to our improvement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;Had not the Souvenir better be given to
a person that <em>does draw</em> very well,&mdash;beautifully, indeed,&mdash;but
that has no money to buy models?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;In one word&mdash;Had not the Souvenir better
be given to Edwin Lovel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;Yes, since it must be told, that is exactly
what I mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;So I guessed from the beginning. But
why did you take such a roundabout way of getting
the book put into his possession?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;Why, I do not suppose he would accept
it from me, a young girl whom he has never seen;
but he would be less scrupulous in taking it as <em>your</em>
gift, as you are an acquaintance of his.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Say, a friend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;I know you so well, that, after our conversation
last night, I was certain, if I gave the book
to you, you would present it at once to the poor boy;
and I was much disconcerted when you pretended at
first that you would keep it always.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Amelia, the book is yours, and the
suggestion is yours, and I will not assume to myself
more merit than I deserve. If you are determined
on giving the Souvenir to Edwin Lovel, the best
way is to seal it up in a sheet of white paper addressed
to him, and with a few words written on the inside,
requesting his acceptance of the book from an
unknown admirer of early genius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;An excellent plan&mdash;I wonder I did not
think of it before. I will set about it directly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Here is a sheet of Ames's best letter-paper,
and here is my new writing-box. Let it be
used for the first time in a good cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;(<i>sits down and writes.</i>)&mdash;I never wrote
any thing with more pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Be sure to put "early genius."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Let me see&mdash;I never saw any writing
of yours look so pretty. Now, I will put up the
parcel, and tie it round with red tape, and seal it, for
girls seldom do such things well&mdash;(<i>he folds the book
in the paper, ties, and seals it.</i>) There, now direct it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;The next thing is, who shall we get to
carry it to Edwin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;Why not William?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;I do not wish my father to know it, lest
he should think I set too little value on his Christmas
present; and I will never ask a servant to do any
thing for me that is to be kept from the knowledge of
my parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Oswald.</span>&mdash;That is right. I will take the packet to
the Intelligence Office, round the corner, and give
one of the black boys that are always loitering there,
a trifle to carry it to Mr. Lovel's, and just leave it
with whoever opens the door.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;That will do very well. Now, Oswald,
make haste, for I hear my father coming.</p>

<p>Oswald easily procured a boy to carry the packet
to the house of Mr. Lovel, who lived in one of the
upper cross streets. The door was opened by the
black girl, who immediately recognised the boy as
an old acquaintance, and commenced a conversation
with him. "Why, Ben," said she, "What is this
you have brought for Master Edwin? I guess it's a
book. It looks 'xactly like one. All done up so
nice, and sealed. Why, I'm puzzled who sended it."
"He did not tell me his name," replied the boy,
"but I guess I know who he is, for all that. It's
Master Oswald Woodley, Mr. Woodley, the great
merchant's eldest son. My aunt is cook there, and
I've often been in the kitchen. And he gave me a
quarter-dollar for carrying it; and it must be 'livered
into Master Edwin's own private, particular hands."</p>

<p>So saying, he departed, and the girl ran up to
Edwin's room, holding out the parcel and saying,
"Master Edwin, here's a book for you, signed, sealed,
and delivered; sent by Master Oswald Woodley,
oldest son of Mr. Woodley the great merchant."</p>

<p>Edwin took the book, and, on opening it, was much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
surprised to find the note written in a female hand,
and the name of Amelia Woodley on the presentation
plate of the Souvenir, which had been inscribed
by her father the preceding evening, and which she
had forgotten to erase before she sent it away. For
some time, his pleasure in examining the beautiful
plates absorbed every other consideration, and it was
not till he had gone twice over them, that he thought
of the mystery connected with the book. His honourable
principles determined him not to accept it,
as he saw that there was some secrecy about the
whole transaction, and that probably the generous
young lady, whose name it bore, had sent it to him
without the knowledge of her parents. The beauty
of the book was a great temptation, and he would
have derived much pleasure from copying some of
the fine plates, but still he could not reconcile it to
his conscience to keep it, neither would he betray
the kind-hearted Amelia to her father. He resolved
to seal it up again, and leave it himself at Mr.
Woodley's door, addressed to Oswald.</p>

<p>He took his last sheet of paper, and wrote in it as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Accident has discovered to me to whom I am
indebted for a most beautiful present, but though it
has excited my warmest gratitude, I cannot consent
to accept it under circumstances of mystery to which
the parents of my kind friend may be strangers. I
return it with a thousand acknowledgments.</p>

<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">Edwin Lovel.</span>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Having looked once more at the engravings, he
put up the Souvenir, and set out himself to leave it
at Mr. Woodley's house, intending to desire the servant
that opened the door to give it to Master Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. Woodley was sitting at the centre-table looking
over some English newspapers, and he found in
one of them a high eulogium on a new picture by
an American artist, now in London. He read the
piece aloud, and when he had concluded, "Amelia,"
said he, "if I am not mistaken, there is in your
Souvenir an engraving from this picture. Let me
look at it again." Amelia coloured and knew not
what to say, and Oswald also seemed much embarrassed.
"My dear," pursued Mr. Woodley, "did
you not hear me? If you can get the book conveniently,
I should like to look at that plate." Amelia,
confused and trembling, tried to speak but could
not, and her eyes were immediately filled with tears.
"Amelia," said Mr. Woodley, "has any accident
happened to the Souvenir?" "No, my dear father,"
she replied, "but I have given it away." "Is it
possible," said Mr. Woodley, "that you were so
soon tired of your father's Christmas gift?" "Oh!
no, no," replied Amelia, "but there is a poor boy
who draws beautifully, and I thought it would make
him so happy. Dear Oswald, tell the whole."</p>

<p>Oswald then, as concisely as possible, related all
the circumstances: and Mr. Woodley, after gently
blaming the children for disposing of the book without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
consulting their parents, kissed Amelia, and commended
her kindness and benevolence in bestowing
her Souvenir on poor Edwin Lovel.</p>

<p>Just then a ring was heard at the front door, and
William brought in and gave to Oswald the packet,
which had been left that moment by Edwin. "Ah!"
exclaimed Oswald, on opening the parcel, "this is
so like Edwin. He sends back the Souvenir." He
then gave Edwin's note to Mr. Woodley, who, after
reading it, went to the desk and wrote a billet addressed
to Edwin's father, in which he requested him
to permit his son to join his family that day at their
Christmas dinner. William was immediately despatched
to Mr. Lovel's with the note, and in a short
time Edwin arrived, looking very happy; and Mr.
Woodley shook him heartily by the hand, on being
introduced to him by Oswald. Then, taking up the
Souvenir, he held it out to Amelia, and desired her
to present it a second time to her brother's young
friend. "With my sanction," said Mr. Woodley to
Edwin, "you will not again refuse my daughter's
gift, though you so honourably returned it when you
suspected that she offered it unknown to her parents."</p>

<p>Edwin spent the day with the Woodley family,
who were all delighted with his modesty and good
sense, and Mr. Woodley made him promise to repeat
his visit as often as he had leisure. That evening,
Amelia's uncle brought her a present of an Album,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
bound in green morocco and handsomely gilt, and
Edwin requested that she would allow him to take it
home and draw something in it.</p>

<p>When he returned the Album, it contained copies,
in Indian ink, of the most beautiful plates of the
Souvenir, executed in Edwin's very best manner.
Mr. Woodley presented Edwin with a portfolio, containing
a selection of fine prints, and eventually made
arrangements with a distinguished artist to take him
as a pupil: his taste for drawing being so decided,
and his indications of genius so extraordinary, it was
thought best to yield to his desire of making painting
his profession.</p>

<p>Finding Edwin's father to be a very deserving
man, Mr. Woodley assisted him to re-establish himself
in business, regretting that he should so long
have been condemned to the irksome life of a teacher
in a school. He was soon enabled to occupy a
better house, and to live once more in the enjoyment
of every comfort.</p>

<h2>THE PERCEVALS.</h2>

<p>Sorrow and joy were both in the house of Mr.
Perceval; for one lovely baby was laid out in its
white shroud, and, in the same hour, another's eyes
first opened on the light. There were two persons
watching in the chamber of death&mdash;the father, who
gazed on the smiling lips and smooth fair brow of
his first-born son, till with tears he blessed the pitying
hand which had stilled the little voice of agony,
and obliterated for ever the traces of pain; and the
nurse, a young and tender-hearted Irish woman, who
had borne the infant sufferer through his brief life of
torment, and now with Christian love hung over the
placid features, that the sinless spirit beautified in
death; till the coffin closed over the transient light,
which the departing soul had left, and the empty
cradle received a new birth. It was long before Eva
could observe, in this unconscious subject of her daily
comparison, any charms to equal those that were
buried with the earlier object of her care; and she
never could avoid contrasting "the tender blue of
those loving eyes," shaded by their silken lashes,
which seemed opening upon her from the tomb, every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
time she looked at the full large orbs, that stared out
of the meagre long face of his unadmired successor;
and she never tired talking of the glossy ringlets, that
she used to twist round the comb, with such elaborate
care, when she was adorning her little Henry for
company; as soon as she saw Alfred's "ugly bare
head," without a lace cap. This young gentleman,
however, paid no attention to such discourse, so unfavourable
to himself, but continued to live on, very
well satisfied with his own share of beauty; and it
was not before two or three years had passed over
his head, and made him vain, that he discovered any
pride in his appearance. But then, when his figure
rounded into perfect shape, when the lace cap was
exchanged for golden ringlets, and the rose and the
lily were blended in his lovely face, he would exhibit,
with great delight, his red shoes, and worked slip,
and coral clasps, which his mother had bought in
the pride of her maternal fondness, to correspond
with the beauty of her son. Mr. Perceval had a
country seat, a short walk from Baltimore, where he
resided with his family during the summer months.
The guns from Fort M'Henry announced our annual
festival&mdash;the soldiers were assembling in the city&mdash;Alfred
heard the drums and the trumpets,&mdash;and the
little hero must go to town, to see the parade. With
many charges to Eva (who was now in the habit of
bringing forward the beauties of her two nurslings,
not "in opposition but in compare") the reluctant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
mother consented to expose her son for a short time,
in the close air of the city, from a natural wish to
gratify his infant taste for "all the pomp and circumstance
of war." I would not like to say, how many
poor children are dragged over the scorching pavements
and burning roads of our town, during the great
national feast, without any refreshment themselves,
except perhaps a glass of heated beer, or a dusted
cake. Alfred Perceval was more fortunate&mdash;supported
in the arms of his careful, tender nurse, from
a window on the shady side of Market street, he saw
the long military line extend from the western extremity
to the bridge. His head moves to the sound
of the music, he springs in Mary's arms, as the horsemen
gallop past; his eyes sparkle at the flashing
swords; and his brave little heart recoils not at the
sound of the guns. When the show was over, Eva
brought him home, and made him a cap of blue paper,
and put a red feather in it. With this on his head,
he strutted about the house, to the music of a cocoanut
shell he had for a kettledrum, which his mother
preferred to that of a tin canister, which the young
musician would have preferred himself. Nothing
could exceed the glow of delight which made Alfred
so beautiful that day, and the parents exulted in the
health of their son. Oh! what a sad reverse, to sink
at once the current of this joy,&mdash;before midnight
their little soldier was raging with fever, and when
the restlessness of the disease was over, it settled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
with a fatal stillness on the brain; and during six
weeks he lay insensible to all that was done to save
him.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe the misery of the
parents, for my story is to be a brief one; but it
pleased the Power of Mercy to abate their hopeless
grief, through the instrumentality of medical skill;
and Alfred once more opened his eyes to a new existence,
and stared around him as he did before. A
cap supplied the place of the beautiful fair curls, that
were all cut away, and the child was placed in Eva's
arms, as helpless and nearly as unconscious then, as
when he first received the precarious gift of life.
But Eva carried him to the garden, and the woods,
where the leaves, now dyed with all the rich tints of
our splendid autumn, presented so many colours to
his sight; and while she called his attention to the
various objects around him, his slow remembrance
returned, and he would smile at all the creatures that
he used to love&mdash;"the beasts of the field and the
fowls of the air." And then she would make him
smell the flowers she culled for him, and listen to the
music of the birds; till at last every sense was restored
to its natural power, and his mind awoke
from its long deep sleep, but the weakness of his
frame continued, and many months passed away, before
he was able to put his feet to the ground; and
by that time, a little brother overtook his steps, and
they both began to walk together; while each had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
his nurse, and his eulogist, who praised her own
charge,&mdash;and no wonder, for Alfred's mind (strengthened,
it would seem, after so long a rest) exhibited,
from day to day, powers of observation and reflection,
much beyond his age. And his happy parents would
often call him their "baby philosopher," while they
smiled with delight at his sage remarks. And Charles
was the prettiest little puppet ever seen; his dancing
steps, always keeping time to the music of his own
thoughts, which were scarcely ever out of tune; and
so fond was he of the exercise of life, that they never
laid him down in his bed, for necessary rest, without
his having a playful struggle against the advances of
sleep; but after kicking his feet against the posts of
his crib, as long as he was able, and singing "by,
by baby"&mdash;after slapping his pillow till he was tired,
he was usually found by his mother asleep, when she
went to bed, with his pocket handkerchief rolled into
a rag baby, and his head lying where his feet ought
to be. But before any one else was stirring in the
morning, he was awake again, when he would stoop
over his low crib, and take his boots in, and while he
was trying to put them on, but succeeded neither by
the heels nor the toes, he would talk to them about
their conduct, or tell himself stories of cats and dogs,
with shawls and bonnets; and pigeons, with yellow
shoes, walking down Market street. Yet with all this
imagination himself, he had so little inclination to
profit by the thoughts of others, that his mother could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
with difficulty teach him the alphabet, before he was
sent to his first school; though his brother (who never
told a story that I remember, except one that had
"seventeen foxes" in it) could read perfectly. With
a foreign teacher, however, Charles seemed very
suddenly to make great advances; and, at four years
of age, he was always head or next to head in his
lessons; to the surprise of his attentive parents, who
could not themselves perceive so great a progress in
learning as this seemed to indicate; but upon investigating
the matter thoroughly, they found out, that
there was only Charles and another little urchin in the
class; which little urchin was to occasion them more
distress, than they ever could have anticipated. One
Sunday, dressed in his finest clothes, he found Charles
at the door of his father's town-house (for it was
early in the spring,) and persuaded him to take a
walk. Accordingly, the two young travellers set off
together, but no sooner had they reached the confines
of the town and point, than they quarrelled about
their future destination; when Master Jacky left
Charles to steer his own course, and ran home as fast
as he could. The poor little fellow scorned to cry,
but wandered about, more and more bewildered, till
he reached one of the wharves, where a Spanish vessel
was about to spread its sails to a fair wind, and
put to sea. Such a strange prospect, opening at once
upon the frightened child, when he thought he was
so many steps nearer home, occasioned an instant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
defeat of all his self-confidence; and he burst out
into a loud and continued cry, which arrested the
attention of a gentleman, who was just at that moment
hurrying to reach the vessel.</p>

<p>The little boy was in distress, and he was compassionate;
but what was to be done? The wharf contained
no individual, but themselves and the sailors;
the wind was fair, and the captain would not delay.
The stranger could not speak the language of the
child, but he smiled while he took his hand, and
smoothed his little brow, and Charles understood him
as well as if he had spoken to him in English; for he
was accustomed to the sight of foreigners in his
father's house, and in a similar manner he always
held discourse with them. So he stopped crying, and
smiled in return; and the gentleman, delighted with
his pleasant looks, gave the child his watch to carry,
while he carried him; for the captain, in a passion, had
ordered the vessel from the shore, and the stranger was
obliged to take Charles on board, or leave him on the
wharf to cry, and perhaps be drowned. While the novelty
of his situation amused his mind, Charles continued
quiet; but after that, when he thought of his nurse, his
tender parents, and his kind brother, at home, his little
heart seemed ready to break; and, only for the constant
tenderness of his unknown friend, I believe he
would have died. But by degrees his grief became
subdued, and before the vessel reached Cuba, he was
the pet of all the sailors, and the delight of his kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
protector; who, after this, could not bear to part with
him, but having no children of his own, he adopted
him, and had him educated as his son: and upon
his approaching death, which happened about six
years after, he left Charles his little property, under
the guardianship of a Boston merchant, with whom
he had been transacting business many years: and
upon whom he now relied, for the discovery of the
parents of the child; which he had been only anxious
to avoid before.</p>

<p>This gentleman went to receive his charge very
willingly; and, on his return to Boston, he placed
Charles in a celebrated school, to which Alfred Perceval
had been sent by his considerate parents when
they found that grief for the loss of his little brother,
had settled too much in studious habits, and aversion
to companionship. Charles's guardian then went to
Baltimore. He was introduced to Mr. Perceval, and
invited to dine at his house. There he told the story
of his little ward; when he was shocked to observe,
what an effect it produced on Mrs. Perceval; for
years had scarcely mitigated the agony she first felt,
at the strange loss of her infant; to which the death
of her eldest son, and the long torpor of his brother,
were supportable distresses; since they were not
aggravated by the power of imagination. But Mr.
Perceval (more collected than she was) could not
avoid seeing, in a similar circumstance, something to
awaken his own hopes; he therefore acquainted the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
gentleman with their loss; and asked him if the child
he spoke of, had ever told his name. "If he did,
sir, my friend, not understanding the rest of his language,
must have forgotten it; but he kept a little
handkerchief, that had been pinned to his robe, and
which I have now in my pocket-book." He drew it
out, and gave it to Mrs. Perceval, who had been
relieved by tears from her first emotion; but when
she saw the initials, C. P., marked by her own hands,
she screamed out&mdash;"Oh! my dear husband, it is our
own son"&mdash;and instantly fainted away. Eva, who
was still in the house, and now attending two fine
little girls, was loudly called by the alarmed Mr. Perceval.
She came directly, and his lady soon recovered
by their united assistance.</p>

<p>The parents then proposed to write instantly for
their sons; but before the letter was sent, they received
one from Alfred, requesting permission to
bring a little Spanish boy home with him, for whom
he had become greatly interested, owing to a circumstance
which happened in school, soon after
Charles was placed there. A large boy, of greater
bulk than manners, took a fancy one day to insult the
feelings of the little foreigner, in a manner he could
not bear; and he flew at his tormentor, who would
instantly have struck him down, had not Alfred Perceval
that moment appeared; who, stepping between
them, pushed the elder boy aside, and then detaining
the other, he said&mdash;"For shame! Roscoe, how can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
you, such a big boy, try the temper of a little stranger
like this, who cannot answer us in our own language?
I thought you had more feeling." "Now,
for one cent I could knock you down, Perceval; but
I don't know how it is, you get the better of us all&mdash;masters
and scholars. However, you'll be going to
college soon," continued the rough boy, dashing
away a tear&mdash;"and, that you may go off with flying
colours, as a peace-maker and a peace-keeper, here's
my hand, little tawney coat, and thank him that you
did not get a good drubbing." But Charles, perhaps
misconceiving the intention of this action, or thinking
that he ought to have the pride of a Spaniard,
turned from Roscoe with disdain, and throwing himself
into the arms of Alfred, he wept with such a
gush of feeling, that it completely overcame the
nerves of that sensitive boy, who struggled in vain
against his own tears, which then flowed at one
thought, and that was of his little brother. But what
was his joy afterward, when his father's letter arrived,
and told him that "the lost was found?" I will
pass over the joy of Mr. and Mrs. Perceval, upon the
first arrival of their sons, for every one can imagine
it; but I must say, that their happiness increased
every day; as they observed, that Charles's Spanish
education had taught him to pursue every thing that
was honourable in principle and practice. He soon
adopted his newly discovered kindred with a strength
of attachment which seemed almost to have some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
early recollection for its foundation. And when Eva
brought his nurse, Sarah, to see him, (who was now
living with her husband in comfortable circumstances,)
he smiled as if he really remembered her,
and Sarah was sure that he did. Mr. and Mrs. Perceval,
considering maturely on the subject, at length
agreed, that it would be better to keep their sons at
home, with proper instructors, until Charles understood
English sufficiently to understand them; when
he could return to school with greater advantage;
and his guardian willingly gave up the future direction
of the person and fortune of his ward to his
most natural directors. Before the vacation ended
then, all Alfred's school companions were invited to a
farewell party, which was prepared with great taste
by his mother. The company assembled&mdash;all the
most distinguished little people of the city; and when
the carpets were thrown aside, and the lamps blazed,
their light young feet gave little rest to the music.
But, though the refreshments were numerous, and
handed round constantly, I believe no young person
was disgraced by an immoderate use of them. Indeed,
I understand that a resolution has been formed
by the most promising youth of our city, to "be
temperate in all things," as republicans ought to
be; and especially to stand always armed against
every device of that treacherous spirit, which entering
alone into the secret folds of inward depravity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
or assailing, with the combined powers of
evil example, the outward avenues to sin, saps the
foundation of the soul, till man becomes a tottering
ruin, and a blighting shade, over his own household;
and a nation is darkened with the wreck of
her sons.</p>

<p>You have read, said General Lawrence to his
children, of the numerous ancient forts and mounds
found in different parts of the now populous state
of Ohio. Some incidents which I shall relate, have
rendered most of them, to me, subjects of great interest.</p>

<p>I was subordinate to General Rufus Putnam, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
he gave directions for the first settlement of Marietta,
by a colony from New-England, in 1788. Ohio,
you know, at that time was called a district, including
the present territories of Michigan, Illinois, and
Indiana, and owned by the general government&mdash;Virginia
having ceded it, seven years before, to the
United States, reserving only some tracts of land as
military bounties for such officers and soldiers as had
been distinguished in the reduction of the British
forts on the Ohio river.</p>

<p>The Chippewas, Miamis, Wyandots,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and other
native tribes, looked, as they well might, with jealous
eyes on the annual encroachments of the whites
upon their hunting-grounds. It is true that they reluctantly
receded as we advanced, but it was under
the stern law of necessity, not a free-will abdication.
I cannot, and do not, pretend to excuse the selfish
rapacity with which many of our ancestors, throughout
the whole country, seized on the soil of the aborigines;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
that is an account which it is not our business
to settle, though we cannot read the true page of
our history without a crimsoning blush of shame.</p>

<p>I remember an act of cold-blooded wickedness,
perpetrated by our people in Ohio about this period,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
which I never could either palliate or forgive. There
was a small encampment of the Wyandots a few
miles from where some of our emigrants had settled.
They were soon apprised of the neighbourhood of
the new residents, and came over to view their
works, sometimes three, four, or more, together.</p>

<p>For some time all things went on well;&mdash;and I
have thought, with the excellent Heckewelder,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that
they need never have done otherwise, had the whites
been just and true to their duty. "They are remarkable,"
says he, "for their <em>domestic</em> and <em>social</em> virtues,
and know how to <em>practice</em> that precept which
we so well teach in <em>theory</em>, viz. '<i>To love their neighbour
as themselves</i>.'"</p>

<p>"The Indians," says one of our early and most
respectable historians, "on their first acquaintance
with the whites, proved themselves kind, generous,
and hospitable, so long as they were treated with justice
and humanity. But so they were not long, and
the consequences are well known to all. In the particular
case of the Wyandots I was unfortunately
witness&mdash;first to the imprudence, and then to the
wickedness of my countrymen."</p>

<p>Evident symptoms of dissatisfaction appeared
whenever they afterward met. Our company began
seriously to fear an attack, (no wonder, they had
given provocation,) and accordingly laid a plan for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
cutting off the Indians at once, instead of attempting
a reconciliation, though I own the latter would not
have been easily effected. The great fault of the
Indian is his thirst for <em>revenge</em>, which, when injured,
he will always seek.</p>

<p>The purpose of the whites was carried into effect
one night, after they had freely supplied the unfortunate
Wyandots with rum. All fell of this portion of
the tribe, save two or three children, who were saved
by one of the party, more humane than his companions,
and an Indian youth, of about fifteen years of
age, called Tecumsoit, and also often known by the
proud appellation of "the Eagle of the West," for
thus early did he discover traits of remarkable
strength and courage. He fought boldly and long,
when his people were sacrificed almost unresistingly
around him, and fled only when so wounded that he
could do no more. He fled&mdash;but in the hope of returning
in power, and making perfect his dreadful
vengeance. His purpose was frustrated but by the
constant watchfulness of the military force which we
were compelled to station wherever there were any
white settlements.</p>

<p>Near Marietta, as I have told you, are remains of
ancient fortifications and mounds, in which the Indians
deposited their dead.</p>

<p>Many such mounds, in different parts of the country,
were laid open by these Indians as the whites advanced;
and the bones of their ancestors, wrapt in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
skins, were carried with them as they retired farther
into the vast forests of the west, where these remains
were sacredly preserved, and guarded with holy
care. Some, however, were left untouched.</p>

<p>I have often examined these very singular sepulchral
monuments, both in the vicinity of Marietta,
and those at Circleville, and I own that I have never
seen one of them demolished without pain.</p>

<p>There was one, near the broken up settlement of
the Wyandots, which offered peculiar interest; it appeared
to have been raised with greater care than the
others, and was evidently of more ancient origin.
This pyramid was in the midst of a grove of noble
forest trees, and brought to mind the solemn Druidical
times of England. When we first discovered it, it
was at an hour when the young Indian girls were
performing round it some religious rites; fruits
of the forest, skins, and flowers, were deposited in
profusion on the pyramidal summit; and the wild
notes of their songs echoed through the grove, giving
back those peculiar strains, softened, but not lost. I
often resorted thither, and when I was summoned to
New-York, that was the last spot which I visited.</p>

<p>I did not return to that part of the country, continued
General Lawrence, for more than ten years,
and then, indeed, could hardly recognise, in the rapid
settlement of the new states, those wide forest-tracts
which I had left; but I own I felt not all the enthusiasm
which filled one of our old historians, when he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
declares that "the wilderness had been made to blossom
as the rose." No, the circumstances of its first
settlement were too recent on my memory for that,
and I had too strong a sympathy for the outcast Indians.
Verily do I believe in that clause of the
fourth commandment, as applied to my countrymen,
"the sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children
to the third and fourth generation;"&mdash;even now
behold its partial fulfilment in the troubles which
have sprung up, and are still gaining accumulated
power, in the rapid increase of our slave population:
"as we have measured, so shall it be measured to us
again."</p>

<p>But, as I was telling you, I revisited Ohio. I
hardly recognised Marietta as I passed through it to
revisit my former station; and the first spot I sought
with real interest, was the ancient mound in the
giant grove. My search was, at first, utterly vain:&mdash;at
length I thought I saw some traces of that which
had once presented a scene of grandeur and beauty,
but I was doubtful long,&mdash;for the grand and lofty
trees "which spread their arms abroad so that all
the birds of the air might have found rest in their
branches,"&mdash;the trees were not there. No, not one
had been spared of that whole sacred grove. The
mound, too, where was it?&mdash;the husbandman had
passed over it with his ploughshare,&mdash;the sower had
strown the seed,&mdash;and the fields were now ripe for
the harvest. I turned away sorrowfully, and my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
eye suddenly caught the figure of an Indian. The
red son of the forest could not be mistaken; he
gazed, as I had done, on the place where his ancestors
of many generations had been laid with reverent
care; his look was proud, sorrowful, and often
changing to one of bitter hate. He did not see me,
for his mind was absorbed in one deep feeling of
lofty desolation, if one may be allowed the use of
such a term. I cannot describe his countenance, for
it varied with every varying thought; but no one
could have contemplated the wild warrior as he stood
erect and alone, his keen eye regarding what was,
and his thought reverting to what had been&mdash;none, I
say, could have seen him without a sentiment of respect,
almost of homage. How few of the race now
retain their original grandeur and lofty character!
Civilization seems only to have weakened and degraded
the Indian mind; his moral state, at least, is now
far more debased than when, with his tribe, he roamed
at will through the immense wilds of the American
continent.</p>

<p>I approached the solitary chief and spoke, (though I
own I felt it an intrusion on his personal feelings;)&mdash;he
looked on me at first with marked disdain, but
presently his countenance changed; a ray of pleasure
lightened his brow,&mdash;but soon an expression of
the most eloquent grief succeeded; it was evident
that he recognized me,&mdash;and I, too, knew Tecumsoit,&mdash;the
Eagle of the West. His words were few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
and brief, for his hitherto unsubdued spirit was bending
beneath the weight of wrong and sorrow, and it
seemed as though he could not speak to a white man,
the fellow of those who had caused his wigwam to
be desolate, and the grove of his fathers polluted by
sacrilege. I understood the sentiment, and was silent
also.</p>

<p>Presently Tecumsoit advanced, thrusting aside and
trampling the waving grain, till he stood at the foot
of the mound: then slowly he took, one by one, the
articles of his dress, and laid them solemnly on the
very summit of the elevation:&mdash;first, his collar of eagle's
feathers,&mdash;then his robe of princely ermine and
sable; to these were added his deer-skin coat, painted
with the rich juices of the pucoon, and colours
derived from plants by a process unknown to any
save the Indians themselves; and, lastly, his wampum
belt, wrought all over with the richly dyed quills
of the porcupine. When these had been thus, one
by one, deposited, he wrapt about him the rough skin
of a panther, gave one long, long look at the sepulchre
of his fathers, and turned silently and abruptly
away. The Eagle was soon lost to my view behind
a range of hills; he had departed for ever from the
home of his childhood; he had cast off the symbols
of his rank, his power, and tribe, and doubtless had
gone to end his days of desolation in some far off
desert, where, though he could not forget his wrongs,
he would at least neither see nor be seen of the white
men.</p>

Often have I thought of Tecumsoit, as I first saw
him, a young boy, the pride of all the warriors, and
the fearless asserter of his rights. I was then his
friend; he seemed to confide in my honour, and he
never had cause to doubt it. I remember him, too,
on the night when I arrived too late to save his family
from the death-shot,&mdash;fearlessly defending himself
and them, when no resource or hope was left. Well
do I remember the mingled despair and pride of his
retreat; and I remember, too, the last time we met
at the mound which held the remains of his ancestors&mdash;the
last look he gave&mdash;and his last shadow on
the hills.</p>

<p>Alas, for Tecumsoit!&mdash;his glory had departed, his
people had passed away, even as the dew beneath
the sultry sun; he was left alone of his race, and,
like Logan, could exclaim&mdash;"Who is there to mourn
for Tecumsoit?&mdash;<em>not one!</em>"</p>

<h2>THE LAUNCH OF THE FRIGATE.</h2>

<p>Cornelia Camelford had just recovered from a
long and dangerous illness, and had not received the
doctor's permission to go out, when much interest
was excited in Philadelphia by the expected launch
of the Guerrier, which was built at Kensington, during
the last war, and called after the first British frigate
that surrendered to the flag of America. Junius
Camelford, who was a midshipman, and the eldest of
Cornelia's two brothers, was highly elated with the
idea of the approaching spectacle, and extremely
impatient for the glorious day (as he called it) to arrive.
At last it came; and the children of Mrs. Camelford
could think and talk of nothing else.</p>

<p>Junius was one of the midshipmen appointed to
the new frigate, and every hour seemed to him an
age until she should be fairly afloat in her proper
element. Boy as he was, he had been on board the
Constitution when she engaged and sunk the British
Guerrier, and had evinced on that memorable day
the courage of a man. When he was afterwards in
Philadelphia, the progress of the new frigate became
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
the leading thought of his mind. He had taken his
sisters to see the keel the day after it was laid: and
had furnished all the young ladies he knew, with
hearts and anchors which he cut out from chips of the
wood.</p>

<p>Mrs. Camelford had been a widow about two
years, and since the death of her husband she had
felt an insurmountable repugnance to appearing in
public, or mixing in a crowd. Therefore she had no
intention of going herself to see the frigate launched,
but she knew that her children would take great
pleasure in the sight, and she loved them too much
to deny them this gratification because she could not
enjoy it herself.</p>

<p>Cornelia was just getting over the same malady
that two years before had been fatal to her father:
and Mrs. Camelford still felt the greatest anxiety
about her, as she was particularly susceptible of cold,
which was always very injurious to her; and the
slightest imprudent exposure might probably bring
on a dangerous relapse.</p>

<p>For this reason, when Mrs. Camelford consented
that her two sons and her daughter Octavia should
go to see the frigate launched, she did not extend the
same permission to the invalid. "And I, dear mother,"
said Cornelia, as she sat at the breakfast table
the first time for near three months, "am I not also
to enjoy the sight?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Camelford.</span>&mdash;My dearest Cornelia, I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
sorry to refuse you that or any other pleasure that
your sister and brothers partake of. But the air from
the river may be cool. Remember that it was only
yesterday you left your chamber, after being confined
to it more than twelve weeks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Octavia.</span>&mdash;Oh! indeed, dear mother, this is quite
a warm day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Camelford.</span>&mdash;To persons in health I know
it is, but though the air is clear and mild, it may be
chilly to poor Cornelia, who is enfeebled by sickness,
and who has been so long shut up in her room. She
has suffered so much already, that I am sure she
must dread every thing that might cause a relapse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span>&mdash;But, dear mother, how will it be possible
for Cornelia to take cold if she is well wrapped
up in her large shawl, and if she wears her close
bonnet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Camelford.</span>&mdash;Indeed, I am afraid she ought
not to venture the slightest risk. Lieutenant Osbrook
has politely offered accommodation for the whole family,
in one of the gun-boats at Kensington, and I have
accepted the invitation for Adrian and Octavia, as
Junius is to be on board the frigate. I believe my
dear Cornelia must content herself with hearing a
description of the launch from her brothers and
sister. I cannot consent to her sitting an hour or two
on the deck of the gun-boat, in the open air, with the
breeze from the river blowing round her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornelia.</span>&mdash;Indeed, mother, I am very sorry, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
hoped to be quite well and able to go any where, before
the launch took place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Junius.</span>&mdash;Still, I think there can be no danger.
Her delight at the spectacle will set her blood in a
glow, as it has mine already, and that will prevent
her taking cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Camelford.</span>&mdash;My dear children, do not urge
me any farther. The sight will no doubt be highly
interesting, but it will be dearly purchased by the return
of Cornelia's late illness.</p>

<p>Cornelia did not reply, but she kissed her mother
in token of acquiescence, and seated herself in a
corner of the sofa with her sewing. In a few minutes
her brother Adrian brought her in a new and
entertaining book, which he had just purchased with
the hope that it would divert her mind from dwelling
on her disappointment. Cornelia took the book very
gratefully, but though it was extremely amusing, her
thoughts still wandered, at times, to Kensington and
the new frigate.</p>

<p>In the course of the morning Mrs. Camelford had
a visit from her friend, Mrs. Dimsdale, who expressed
great pleasure at finding Cornelia down stairs, and
hoped she was well enough to go to see the ship
launched.</p>

<p>Mrs. Camelford explained that she had refused
Cornelia her permission to join the little party in the
gun-boat, being afraid of her taking cold if exposed
to the air of the river. "Oh! if that is all," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Mrs. Dimsdale, "the difficulty, I hope, can be easily
obviated. Mr. Dimsdale and myself are going to
take the children up to Kensington in one of the
steam-boats. You know the boats are all put in
requisition for the accommodation of persons that wish
to see the show. If you will permit Cornelia to accompany
our family, she can stay all the time in the
cabin, and have an excellent view from the stern
windows, without any exposure at all."</p>

<p>Cornelia's eyes turned upon her mother, with a
look of entreaty. Mrs. Camelford hesitated a few
moments, and Octavia ventured again to supplicate
in behalf of her sister. At last, Cornelia obtained
permission to go with the Dimsdales: and it was arranged
that Mrs. Camelford's carriage was to take
them down to the steam-boat, after which it was to
return immediately and convey the other party to
Kensington.</p>

<p>When Adrian came home from school, and Junius
from the ship-yard, (where he had almost lived for
several days,) the boys were delighted to find that
Cornelia was, at last, allowed an opportunity of seeing
the launch. They had an early dinner, of which
Lieutenant and Mrs. Osbrook had been invited to
partake, and in a short time after the carriage was
at the door. Cornelia was carefully wrapped in her
large shawl, and Mrs. Camelford said to her, "Now,
my dear, you must promise me that you will remain
all the time in the cabin of the boat, and not allow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
yourself to be tempted to go on deck, even for a few
moments." "Certainly, dear mother," replied Cornelia,
"I will cheerfully make that promise, for I am
thankful that you will allow me to see the frigate on
any terms." Mrs. Camelford kissed Cornelia, and
her brothers put her into the carriage, which, on its
way down to the wharf, stopped to take up Mr. and
Mrs. Dimsdale and their two children.</p>

<p>Cornelia felt very happy at finding herself once
more riding through the streets, after so long a confinement
to her chamber. Every well known store
and house seemed to interest her as she passed, and
all the people she saw appeared to her to look unusually
well. She soon found herself seated in the
after-cabin of the steam-boat, which was crowded
with females, and so warm that Cornelia had no
occasion to wear her shawl: her mother having
told her that she might take it off, if she found it
oppressive.</p>

<p>The carriage having returned, Mr. and Mrs. Osbrook,
with Adrian and Octavia, got into it and rode
to Kensington; Junius, in a new suit of uniform, and
with a new cockade in his hat, having long before set
out on foot, as he despised riding when it was practicable
to walk, and the distance from his mother's house
to the ship-yard now seemed almost nothing, having
been so often traversed by him. In a very short
time, he was on the deck of the frigate, with a number
of officers and other gentlemen, beside the shipwrights.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
That afternoon, almost all the stores in
Philadelphia were shut up, and few of the inhabitants
remained in their houses. Till near three
o'clock, the whole population of the city seemed to
be pouring toward the Northern Liberties: all the
streets in the direction of Kensington being crowded
with people.</p>

<p>When the party from Mrs. Camelford's arrived at
the river-side, the vast concourse far exceeded their
expectations, though Junius had told them that the
crowd had begun to assemble as early as twelve
o'clock. They were soon seated on chairs, on the
deck of the gun-boat, and Lieutenant Osbrook left the
ladies under the care of another gentlemen, while
he went on board the frigate.</p>

<p>The river was covered with boats of every description,
filled with people. The roofs, as well as
the windows of the houses and stores that commanded
a view of the water, were crowded with spectators;
and so also were the trees. Scaffolds, which had
been erected for the purpose, were lined with tiers of
occupants, one row above another. All the ships,
then in port, had gone up to Kensington, and their
decks were covered with ladies and gentlemen; the
sailors taking their stations in the rigging. In two or
three vessels were bands of military music, and
a third band was playing in the frigate that was the
object of so much interest. All the officers then in
the city (and many had come thither on purpose)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
were present: and all, both of army and navy, were
in full uniform. Nothing could be more gay and
animated than the whole scene. Every one was
attired to the best advantage, and the white dresses
and green parasols of the ladies added much to the
picturesque effect of the scene. The steam-boats
came up filled with passengers, and were anchored
at a convenient distance.</p>

<p>The gentlemen took out their watches frequently,
as the time approached when the tide was to turn; for
the frigate was to be launched on the top of high
water. As the moment drew near, every eye was
fixed on the noble vessel, and there was a breathless
anxiety of the most intense interest. The carpenters
stood with their arms raised, ready to knock away
the blocks that held her. The signal was given, and
it was done. The frigate began to move&mdash;every hat
was simultaneously taken off&mdash;the guns from all the
armed vessels fired a salute&mdash;the music struck up,
"The Tars of Columbia"&mdash;and loud huzzas resounded
from thousands of voices. The frigate glided
gracefully and rapidly along, amidst repeated shouts
of acclamation, with the colours of her country flying
at her stern: and, when she plunged into the
water, (which she threw up tremendously about her,)
the violent agitation of the river, for a considerable
distance round, announced that she had reached the
element which she was never more to leave. On her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
bowsprit stood the boatswain, who christened her by
breaking a bottle of liquor over her head, and shouting,
"Hurra for the Guerrier!" And the shout was repeated
by every man present: thousands of hats waving
round from the river and from the shore.</p>

<p>The moment "the gallant Guerrier" was afloat,
she turned round majestically with the tide, and an
anchor, for the first time, descended from her bow,
mooring her, for the present, in the place where she
had entered the water. The music continued for
some time to play the favourite national airs, and at
length the vast concourse of spectators began to turn
their steps toward home. Adrian and Octavia could
talk of nothing in the carriage but the scene they had
just witnessed, and they gave their mother a most
animated account of it. Mr. and Mrs. Osbrook took
their leave and returned to their own residence: and
soon after Junius came home in a state of the highest
excitement, his eyes sparkling, his cheeks glowing,
and full of the honour and glory, as he called it, of
having been on board of the new Guerrier when she
was launched. He inquired almost immediately for
Cornelia. The carriage had been sent down to the
steam-boat to bring her home, and in a short time she
arrived, but looking very pale.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Cornelia," said Junius, as he led
her to the sofa, "was it not a glorious sight? Was it
not a show worth looking at? I never was so delighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
in all my life, except when we heard the lee-gun
of the <em>British</em> Guerrier, as a signal of surrender,
after her colours had been shot away."</p>

<p>"Tell me, dearest girl," said Adrian, "were not
your expectations more than realized? Did you ever
see any thing so interesting as the launch of the
frigate?"</p>

<p>Cornelia's eyes filled with tears, and her lips trembled,
as she replied, in a faltering voice, "I did not
see it at all."</p>

<p>"Not see it!" was the general exclamation.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I did not," repeated Cornelia.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Junius.</span>&mdash;What! <em>nothing</em> of it! <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornelia.</span>&mdash;Nothing whatever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Junius.</span>&mdash;Oh! Cornelia, you are certainly jesting.
What! go on purpose to see the launch, and still <em>not</em>
see it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Camelford.</span>&mdash;My beloved Cornelia, you
alarm me. I hope you have not been ill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornelia.</span>&mdash;No, my dear mother, not at all. But,
indeed, I have been very much disappointed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Octavia.</span>&mdash;Oh! pray tell us how.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornelia.</span>&mdash;Mrs. Dimsdale sat with me in the ladies'
cabin of the steam-boat, till her husband, who
had been on deck with the children, came to conduct
her up stairs, as the time for the frigate to go off was
drawing very near. She then tried to persuade me
that no harm could possibly arise from my going on
deck for a few minutes, and, to own the truth, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
thought so myself. But I told her that I had obtained
permission to go in the steam-boat, only upon condition
of remaining all the time in the cabin, and I
could, on no account, break my promise and disobey
my mother. She then complimented me by saying
that I was the most obedient and conscientious child
she had ever known, and expressing her regret that I
could not accompany her, she ran hastily on deck
with Mr. Dimsdale, lest she should be too late.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Octavia.</span>&mdash;But could you have no view from the
cabin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cornelia.</span>&mdash;I had anticipated no difficulty, but
when I rose to look out, I found the windows entirely
blocked up with women and babies, of whom there are
always so many in steam-boats. The shelves or high
seats at the stern were covered with them, crowded so
closely that they seemed almost wedged into a mass.
I climbed up and tried to get a peep between their
heads, but all in vain, for they were pressing on each
other's shoulders. For a moment, I was tempted to
go on deck; but I remembered my promise. Suddenly,
I heard an exclamation of "There she goes,"
and I knew by the shouts, the firing, and the music,
that the frigate was moving. In vain I stretched my
neck and strained my eyes, to catch a glimpse between
the heads and bonnets; all the windows were entirely
filled, and I had not the smallest chance of seeing any
thing. I soon gave up all hope; I sat down in a chair,
and I acknowledge that I could not help crying a little,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
though I took care to conceal my tears as much as I
could. And perhaps I would not have cried, only that
my long illness had weakened my spirits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Junius.</span>&mdash;(Taking her hand)&mdash;Oh! yes, my poor
Cornelia, you would have cried all the same, even
if you had not been weak and ill. I am certain you
would, for it was a disappointment worth crying for.</p>

<p>Mrs. Camelford was so much affected that it was
some time before she could speak, and then embracing
Cornelia most tenderly, she said, "You are a
dear good girl, and from this instance of obedience
and self-denial, at so early an age, I anticipate the
most happy results when you are older. If the
pleasure of knowing how much gratification your
conduct has afforded your mother, and how much
more than ever she loves you, can compensate for
your disappointment, you may now enjoy that reward."
Cornelia threw herself into her mother's
arms, and kissing her affectionately, wept in silence
while Octavia sobbed aloud, tears dropped on the
cheeks of Adrian, and Junius drew his hand across
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Octavia, "how little did we think,
when we were all enjoying the sight from the gun-boat,
with ample room and an uninterrupted view,
that our poor sister, after being three months shut
up in her chamber, was seeing nothing at all."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span>&mdash;Yes, and when we were riding home,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
I wished that Cornelia were with us, that she might
tell us what she thought of it; supposing, of course,
that she had seen all that we did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Junius.</span>&mdash;Well, dear Cornelia, be comforted.
There is no danger of your having taken cold, since
you so scrupulously kept your promise and obeyed
your mother; and, as you will now, no doubt, continue
well, I hope you will yet be able to see the
frigate before she sails on her first cruise, though
you <em>have</em> missed the launch, which was certainly one
of the finest sights ever seen in the whole world.
Do not smile, Octavia. You are not, as I am, one of
the "Tars of Columbia."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Adrian.</span>&mdash;No, indeed. And if she was a sailor,
I hope she would feel like one upon such occasions.</p>

<p>Cornelia continued every day to improve in health,
and when the frigate was completely fitted up and
ready for sea, Lieutenant Osbrook came to invite the
Camelford family on board, and Mrs. Camelford
herself was prevailed upon to be one of the party.
Junius, taking Cornelia's hand, led her carefully
through the vessel, explaining to her its different
parts and their uses, and replying, kindly and satisfactorily,
to all the various questions which she would
not have ventured to ask, except of her brother.</p>
